We copied + pasted all the articles into the Python file. 

Later we preprocessed the articles by removing numbers, symbols and made the text in lowercase to avoid double representations of words.

Computed TF-IDF on all the words in each document in the repository

Computed TF-IDF for the query

Used cosine similarity to find similarity between the query to the documents
