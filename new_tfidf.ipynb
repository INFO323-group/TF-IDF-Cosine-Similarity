    "Case Presentation\n",
    "A 28-year-old man presented with shortness of breath, chest pain, and scant hemoptysis. Three weeks previously, he was admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia that had been diagnosed by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction. Chest CT imaging demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities without evidence of VTE. He was treated with hydroxychloroquine, up to 7 L/min oxygen, and self-proning. After 8 days of hospitalization, he was discharged on 4 L/min oxygen. After discharge, his symptoms and hypoxia resolved.\n",

    "Previous article in issueNext article in issue\n",
    "Two weeks after initial hospitalization, he presented with new-onset chest pain due to a right-sided pneumothorax. After chest tube thoracostomy, the pneumothorax resolved, and the next day he was discharged on 1 L/min oxygen. Figure 1 shows patient's chest CT from initial hospitalization with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, and Figure 2 shows patient's chest radiographs from second hospitalization with pneumothorax.\n",

    "What is the diagnosis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnosis: Rupture of COVID-19-induced pneumatocele caused a pneumothorax and a loculated hydropneumothorax\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "Pneumatoceles are lung cysts, which are defined as intraparenchymal air-filled spaces with distinct thin walls that occur after pneumonia or trauma. These cavities are formed when prior lung necrosis resolves into an air-filled cavity that subsequently is maintained by inflammatory cells within the feeding airway that act as a one-way valve. Pneumatoceles are differentiated from other types of lung cysts, such as incidental cysts, by their transient nature and association with known inciting events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cystic structures that meet the definition of pneumatoceles have been described during COVID-19 pneumonia, although their natural history is unknown. In non-COVID disease states, pneumatoceles typically resolve without intervention. However, pneumatoceles may become infected, expand and cause tension physiologic conditions, or rupture resulting in pneumothorax. These complex pneumatoceles can be treated successfully with catheter placement or surgical intervention. However, there are no widely accepted guidelines on to how to manage pneumothorax in this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pneumothorax is defined by air in the pleural space; a pneumothorax that occurs without an inciting event is known as a spontaneous pneumothorax. A spontaneous pneumothorax that occurs in patients with no known lung disease is called a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP); a pneumothorax that occurs in the setting of an underlying lung disease is known as a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP). However, up to 60% of patients with presumed PSP have undiagnosed blebs and bullae that can be detected by chest CT imaging, which makes the distinction between PSP and SSP less clear. Causes of SSP are heterogenous, given the variety of predisposing illnesses that include emphysema, cystic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, lung malignancy, and necrotizing pneumonia. In the initial AIDS epidemic, pneumocystosis due to Pneumocystis jirovecii was a well-known cause of spontaneous pneumothorax, including spontaneous bilateral pneumothoraces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pneumothoraces can become loculated when air is trapped in a cavity between lung and chest wall due to adhesions. In the case of a loculated hydropneumothorax that occurs in a lung fissure, it can be difficult to differentiate from a pulmonary abscess or large pneumatocele. A combination of epidemiology, symptoms, laboratory data, and chest imaging may aid in this process. Most pulmonary abscesses are caused by aspiration and involve polymicrobial infections that include anaerobic bacteria. Unlike pneumatoceles, which are typically asymptomatic and resolve without intervention, pulmonary abscesses present with fever, cough, and/or chest pain. A hydropneumothorax is caused by a variety of processes that include necrotizing pneumonia and thoracic procedures with variable symptoms that reflect both the size of the hydropneumothorax and state of the underlying condition. A loculated hydropneumothorax in a fissure is likely to be elliptical on coronal imaging, to have a smooth inner surface, and to displace airways. In contrast, a pneumatocele is commonly spherical on coronal imaging, and a pulmonary abscess typically has thick walls with airways that lead into or through the cavity, potentially creating air bronchograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current guidelines by the British Thoracic Society indicate that PSP can be managed in the outpatient setting with observation if the pneumothorax is small and asymptomatic but recommend admission for supplemental oxygen and needle decompression if the pneumothorax is large or if the patient is symptomatic. Chest tube placement is reserved for patients in whom needle decompression fails. Surgical intervention with pleurodesis should be considered in patients with recurrent pneumothorax or persistent air leak after chest tube placement. Guidelines do not recommend obtaining a chest CT image in cases of PSP. However, there is considerable debate around this topic because chest CT imaging might identify patients with PSP who would benefit from surgical management to prevent recurrent pneumothorax.\n",
    "\n",
    "For SSP, the British Thoracic Society recommends a more aggressive treatment approach. All patients with SSP should be admitted, regardless of intervention strategy. Additionally, most patients with symptomatic pneumothorax should be treated with chest tube placement and consideration of surgical intervention, such as video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with pleurodesis. These guidelines are based largely on epidemiologic data that suggests that SSP is less likely to resolve and more likely to recur than PSP. Management of a hydropneumothorax is guided currently by expert opinion and case reports. Although the British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest that most patients will require chest tube drainage, the final management approach should be based on both the clinical status of the patient and the diagnostic testing that is required to identify and treat the cause of the patient’s hydropneumothorax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical Course\n",
    "After chest tube placement for his recurrent pneumothorax, the patient’s symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and scant hemoptysis improved. His sputum stains and cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. Blood cultures were negative. Based on the lack of infectious symptoms and chest CT findings of a thin-walled elliptical fluid-filled air cavity at the site of the major fissure, the large air-fluid filled structure was deemed a loculated hydropneumothorax rather than a large pneumatocele or lung abscess. On day 5, there was no longer an air leak from the chest tube, and it was successfully removed. Surgical referral for pleurodesis was deferred as the pneumatoceles had diminished in size. At 1-month follow up, the patient’s symptoms had largely resolved. Repeat chest CT images demonstrated resolution of prior pneumatoceles and a significant decrease in the size of the loculated hydropneumothorax (Fig 4).\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "It has been recently hypothesized that infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to fibrotic sequelae in patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this observational study, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had a HRCT of the chest performed to detect the extension of fibrotic abnormalities via Hounsfield Units (HU). At follow-up, the lung density significantly improved in both lungs and in each lobe of all patients, being in the normal range (− 950 to − 700 HU). This study provides preliminary evidence that hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate forms of COVID-19 are not at risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by non-specific symptoms. The disease presentation may range from lack of clinical signs in asymptomatic patients to severe interstitial pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Moving from the evidence that infection by other respiratory coronaviruses is associated with significant post-viral lung fibrosis, it has been recently hypothesized that there could also be fibrotic consequences related with COVID-19 [1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to assess the real risk of developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, we have carried out an observational study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) at hospital admission and follow-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials and methods\n",
    "Study design\n",
    "A high-quality, single-group, prospective, observational study was performed in agreement with the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) recommendations at the Unit of Respiratory Disease at the University Hospital “Tor Vergata” in Rome (Italy) [3]. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of University Hospital “Policlinico Tor Vergata\", Rome, Italy (protocol no. 83/20, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of patients\n",
    "All the COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the ward of “Respiratory Medicine” between March 16th 2020 and April 16th 2020 who underwent HRCT of the chest both at admission and at follow-up were consecutively included in the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The severity of COVID-19 was ranked in agreement with arterial blood gas analysis findings, namely mild in the presence normal ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the inspired fraction of oxygen (P/F) or of mild hypoxemia, moderate for picture of ALI, and severe for picture of ARDS [4, 5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Endpoints\n",
    "The primary endpoint of this study was the change from baseline in Hounsfield Units (HU), that has been shown to be an effective method to identify interstitial lung abnormalities [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The secondary endpoints were the change from baseline in Total Severity Score (TSS) [7] and the presence of significant extension of fibrotic abnormalities at follow-up [8]. HRCT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analysed. Each lung lobe was eveluated for the percentage of involvement by assigning a score of 0 for 0% involvement, 1 for 1–25% involvement, 2 for 26–50% involvement, 3 for 51–75% involvement, and 4 for 76–100% involvement. The TSS, ranging from 0 to 20, was reached by summing the score of the lung lobes [7]. Extension of fibrotic abnormalities was assessed as previously described [8]. Two radiologists reviewed all images independently blinded to the clinical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further variables were investigated at follow-up, namely the lung function via pulmonary function test to assess forced expiratory volume in 1st s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), sub-maximal exercise test via six-minute walk test (6MWT), and dyspea via Borg scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The follow-up visits were performed between April 27th 2020 and May 29th 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis\n",
    "The relationship between the change from baseline in HU and TSS was assessed via the Pearson correlation coefficient. Data were reported as mean and 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) or median with range and interquartile range (IQR), with statistical significance set for p < 0.05. HU was assessed via the IntelliSpace software (Philips, Milan, Italy) and GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform the statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Twenty-seven patients out of the 109 hospitalized subjects were included in this study as they had HRCT at both admission and follow-up. The patients baseline characteristics were: age 60.79 years (95%CI 57.11–64.46), 20 men and 7 women. Arterial blood gas analysis showed in 11.11% of patients a picture of ARDS, in 37.04% of ALI, 18.52% of mild hypoxemia, and 33.33% had a normal P/F ratio [5]. Patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (100%), macrolides (96.30%), antiviral drugs (92.59%), low-molecular weight heparin (92.59%), corticosteroids (77.78%), tocilizumab (37.04%). 33.33% of patients received noninvasive ventilation, the remaining oxygen therapy as needed. No patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Although the HU of both lungs was in the normal range (− 950 to − 700 HU) at hospital admission in most patients (HU: median − 810, IQR − 773 to − 838, range − 696 to − 870), GGO (HU cut-off: − 700) [6] was detected in nearly a quarter of patients at the level of the left and right lower lobes (HU: median − 792, IQR − 72 to − 829, range − 586 to − 868). At follow-up, 47.74 days (95%CI 43.42–52.06) post-admission, the lung density significantly (p < 0.001, assessed via paired t-test) improved in both the lungs (delta HU: − 45.16) and in each lobe, including the left and right lower lobes (delta HU: − 67.6), being in the normal range and indicating the lack of GGO (Fig. 1a–g) [6]. TSS also significantly (p < 0.001, assessed via paired t-test) improved at follow-up (TSS: median 7, IQR 5–8, range 2–15) when compared with admission (TSS: median 3, IQR: 2–4, range: 0–6) (Fig. 1h). In none of the follow-up HRCTs significant extension of fibrotic abnormalities including reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing were detected.\n",

The post-6MWT sensation of dyspnoea was clinically and statistically significant (delta pre-post 6MWT Borg scale: median 1.5, IQR 0.3–2, range 0–5; p < 0.05) [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "This study provides the preliminary evidence that in hospitalized patients with prevalently mild-to-moderate forms of COVID-19 pulmonary opacity was completely recovered at follow-up, with no evidence of any fibrotic abnormality. Interestingly, at follow-up also lung function and exercise capacity were in the normal range. These findings suggest that these patients are not at risk of developing post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. However, also considering that abnormal pulmonary function was detected in COVID-19 patients at time of hospital discharge [10], the results of this study have to be confirmed in larger and longer studies, and verified also in patients with severe COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the main limit of this study is related with the preliminary nature of the investigation, as the analysis was performed on a small sample size. However, we have to highlight that no restrictions in the inclusion of patients were applied, and that all the patients were chosen consecutively at hospital admission, regardless of age and sex. This last point is important to prevent potential bias, as older male patients show more severe COVID-19 symptoms when compared to younger female patients [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, despite the intrinsic limitations of this study, here we provided for the first time the suggestion that HU and TSS are directly correlated, at least in the COVID-19 population investigated in this study.\n",

    "In a systematic review, Ahmed et al.10 described the clinical characteristics of 662 children with MIS-C, but reported no long-term\n",
    "consequences other than MIS-C. It was unclear if any of the MIS-C\n",

    "4 | DISCUSSION\n",
    "This paper presents detailed parent reported data on five children\n",
    "with potential long COVID that lasted for more than 2 months, which\n",
    "was the mean duration reported by Carfi et al.'s follow-up of adults\n",
    "with long COVID.7\n",
    " In fact, the children all had symptoms for at least\n",
    "6 months. The children who were between 9 and 15 years of age had\n",
    "substantial difficulties many months after the onset of COVID-19\n",
    "and this was reflected by their poor school attendance.\n",
    "In Sweden, preschools and elementary schools were kept open\n",
    "during the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020.29 Early COVID19 reports suggested that children had milder disease symptoms\n",
    "than adult and a better prognosis. During late spring 2020, reports\n",
    "started to emerge of a Kawasaki-like hyperinflammation.4\n",
    " Widely\n",
    "known as MIS-C,10 this often occurs in children who test positive\n",
    "for antibodies and it is possible that it appears after a diagnosis of\n",
    "COVID-19 infection, rather than during the acute phase of the disease. However, my impression is that MIS-C remains an uncommon\n",
    "complication in children with COVID-19.\n",
    "Of the five children in our case report, four were female and that\n",
    "ratio of 4:1 was also reported by a French study. The hospital saw\n",
    "some 30 patients weeks with persistent symptoms and noted that\n",
    "many were females around 40 years of age.30 Since the data were\n",
    "collected on the five children in the case report, more parents have\n",
    "contacted the author and the majority of those had daughters who\n",
    "seems to have long COVID.\n",
    "This case report yields no clues about the frequency of long\n",
    "COVID in children. In adults, a review by Greenhalgh et al.5\n",
    " suggested\n",
    "that up to 1 in 10 adults suffered prolonged symptoms up to 3 weeks\n",
    "after COVID-19 was diagnosed. Clearly, future studies should look\n",
    "into the prevalence of long-term complications from COVID-19 in\n",
    "children. While earlier risk factors for prolonged COVID-19 have\n",
    "been reported in adults,5\n",
    " none of the papers covered by our systematic review discussed predisposing factors. Four of the five children\n",
    "in the case report had no comorbidities prior to COVID-19. The fifth\n",
    "had asthma, allergies and autism spectrum disorder. The fact that\n",
    "long COVID may occur in healthy children is consistent with data in\n",
    "adults.30 None of the children was admitted to hospital at the onset\n",
    "of COVID-19, but the girl with prior comorbidities did spend 3 days\n",
    "in hospital with peri-myocarditis 3 months after she was diagnosed\n",
    "with COVID-19. In addition, many adults with long COVID have had\n",
    "mild initial disease.\n",
    "Carfi et al.7\n",
    " described the 143 adults admitted to hospital for\n",
    "COVID-19, who were followed up at an average of 60 days after disease onset, in a research letter to JAMA. Of these more than 87% \n",
    "   | LUDVIGSSON  919\n",
    "had at least one persistent symptom and most frequent were fatigue, dyspnoea, joint pain and chest pain.\n",
    "All five children in our study reported fatigue and dyspnoea,\n",
    "but joint pain and chest pain were also common. Other symptoms\n",
    "ranged from neurological complaints to skin rashes, sleep disorders,\n",
    "depression, muscle pain and remitting fever. However, fatigue seems\n",
    "to stand out as the predominant symptom and it persisted at end of\n",
    "follow-up in all five children. In a paper by Rubin,6\n",
    " unpublished data\n",
    "from 1500 long COVID adult patients showed fatigue to be the most\n",
    "frequent persisting symptom. Long-term fatigue is not uncommon\n",
    "after other viral infections.31 When Lam et al.32 followed up 369 severe acute respiratory syndrome survivors 4 years after they developed the disease in the first decade of this century, they found that\n",
    "more than 40% reported fatigue. Although it is often overlooked,\n",
    "narcolepsy, which is characterised by extreme fatigue, increased\n",
    "substantially among unvaccinated Swedish children during the H1N1\n",
    "influenza pandemic of 2009–2010. It is likely that this reflected increased exposure to the influenza virus.33\n",
    "All five children in our case report also reported dyspnoea, which\n",
    "Carfi et al.7\n",
    " saw in 43% of their adults with long COVID. Other frequent symptoms, reported by one in five adults in that study, were\n",
    "heart palpitations and chest pain.7\n",
    " Data now suggest that COVID19 may have cardiovascular consequences in both adults34 and children10,15,25 and that chest pain is common in adults.5,7 It is notable\n",
    "that several of the children in our case report had palpitations, with\n",
    "a high pulse rate on exertion and an inability to perform physical\n",
    "activity. In addition, the only child who was hospitalised in our case\n",
    "report had peri-myocarditis.\n",
    "The children in our case report also experienced gastrointestinal, neurological and cognitive symptoms, which were all consistent with the extra-pulmonary manifestations reported in acute COVID-19 patients.5,35\n",
    "It is interesting that sometimes several people in the same family\n",
    "as the children in this report had long COVID. This suggests that\n",
    "shared genetic or environmental traits might predispose some individuals to long COVID.\n",
    "4.1 | Clinical implications\n",
    "Most children with COVID-19 show few symptoms and have a mild\n",
    "form of the disease.8\n",
    " However, it has become clear that a small proportion develop MIS-C10 and some may even need intensive care.13\n",
    "Although the current systematic review found no earlier reports of\n",
    "long COVID, the five children aged 9–15 years in our case report\n",
    "testify to the existence of long-term complications from COVID-19\n",
    "in children. While I was writing this case report, I became aware of\n",
    "even more children with long COVID, as more parents contacted me,\n",
    "but these were not included in this case report.\n",
    "This case report and review raise a number of questions and\n",
    "point to future research needs. More research is needed into the\n",
    "prevalence and prognosis of long COVID in children. Affected children need relevant follow-up visits that consider child-specific aspects and the strategy outlined by Greenhalgh et al.5\n",
    " may be a useful\n",
    "starting point. The fact that the children in the case report had still\n",
    "not returned fully to school at the time of writing, despite Swedish\n",
    "schools being open for children up to the age of 16 throughout the\n",
    "pandemic8\n",
    " adds to the seriousness of the matter.\n",
    "Swedish healthcare36 should follow-up children with long COVID\n",
    "and their rehabilitation needs should be assessed.\n",
    "4.2 | Strengths and limitations\n",
    "This study had some strengths and limitations. One strength was\n",
    "the systematic search of a number of highly respected medical databases, including the medRxiv/bioRxiv pre-print servers. Despite\n",
    "our extensive search, I failed to identify any report that specifically\n",
    "described long COVID in children.\n",
    "The limitations of our review include the lack of granular data on\n",
    "blood tests and other investigations to rule out differential diagnoses. Although I cannot rule out that the children had MIS-C, or even\n",
    "Kawasaki disease, the long symptom duration argues against MIS-C\n",
    "and Kawasaki disease as the explanation for the symptoms of these\n",
    "children. The data in the case reports were reported by the parents\n",
    "of the five children. Given the clinical spectrum of long COVID in\n",
    "the five patients, full haematology, electrolytes, cardiac markers\n",
    "and inflammatory markers would have been useful. Tests to rule out\n",
    "differential diagnoses, such as other inflammatory or autoimmune\n",
    "conditions, would also have been useful. Several, but not all of the\n",
    "patients in our case report, had undergone heart examinations. Still\n",
    "it would have been preferable to include detailed echocardiography\n",
    "data on all five children in this review.\n",
    "It is possible that the children in this case report have more severe long COVID than the average child. The fact that their parents\n",
    "reached out to the medical community may also signal that their children had a severe form of long COVID.\n",
    "Although all of the five children had been diagnosed with\n",
    "COVID-19 by their respective physicians, none of them had been\n",
    "tested positive for COVID-19 at the time of their diagnosis. It\n",
    "worth noting that it has been suggested that a positive test is not\n",
    "required for a diagnosis of long COVID.5\n",
    " That fact that the polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative is not\n",
    "surprising, since they were not obtained during the acute phase\n",
    "of COVID-19. Sweden suffered from a lack of testing equipment\n",
    "during spring 2020 when these children fell sick,29 and testing was\n",
    "primarily targeted at hospital inpatients and healthcare personnel. Still I acknowledge that other explanations for the ongoing\n",
    "symptoms cannot be fully ruled out. None of the children were\n",
    "admitted to hospital during spring 2020, but patient two was later\n",
    "admitted for peri-myocarditis.\n",
    "5 | CONCLUSION\n",
    "This case report on five children and the accompanying systematic\n",
    "review add to the growing evidence that long COVID may potentially \n",

    "occur also in children and that it can be very debilitating and lead\n",

    "Droplets fall quickly from the air in close proximity to thehost and do not ﬂoat through the air. Aerosols, particlessmaller than droplets, transmit SARS-CoV-2 over greaterdistances and times because they ﬂoat and can remain sus-pended in the air for hours. Additionally, the smaller theparticle, the more likely it is to reach the lower respiratorytract when inhaled10; larger droplets are more likely to becaught in the nasal passages, larger airways and paranasalsinuses.11Although the disease may be acquired throughthese structures, small particles, speciﬁcally those less thanone micron, carry little virus due to their small size, but ﬂoatfor hours.Most concerning are “medium-sized”particles that fallbetween 1 and 5 mm.12These are produced in higher pro-portion during speech and singing.13They tend to carry ahigher viral load, and, once in the air, their moisture evapo-rates and turns them into virally concentrated “dropletnuclei.\"14The medium-sized particles are able to ﬂoat forhours, ﬁnd the lower airways with a higher viral load perparticle, and carry a higher probability than particles ofother sizes or droplets of successfully infecting a susceptiblehost. Both small and medium-sized particles are generatedfrom the alveoli of lungs (smallest air sacs where oxygenexchange occurs) by way of a “ﬂuid ﬁlm burst”as the alveoliopen and close during breathing.15It has been long estab-lished that breathing and speaking lead to aerosolization ofparticles.16Vocal folds also have a ﬂuid ﬁlm, and theirvibration likely contributes to the generation of medium-sized particles. This may be why speaking and singing pro-duce more medium-sized aerosols and why singers might beat increased risk of transmission. Asadi et al demonstratedthat increased vocal amplitude (loudness) led to increasedaerosolization due to more medium-sized particles beingemitted. In addition, they demonstrated that some peoplemay be “speech superemitters”who emit particles at ratesan order of magnitude higher than others for yet-to-be-determined reasons.13A recent study using a laser particlecounter demonstrated higher aerosolization rates from sing-ing as compared to speaking among 8 professional singers.17While not true with all viruses (speciﬁcally inﬂuenza), itwas recently demonstrated that large droplets and medium-sized particles of SARS-CoV-2 are stopped by a surgicalface mask (article did not specify type of surgical face mask,but was not N95 etc); however, small particles may stillescape the mask into the air.18Surgical face masks thus sig-niﬁcantly mitigate the risk of disease spread (although by nomeans are the sole consideration as discussed earlier). Clothmasks of various materials also mitigate risk because theystop droplet and hopefully most medium-sized particletransmission. However, it is impossible to determine theability of cloth masks to stop all medium-sized particlesbecause of the masks’heterogeneity. In a recent opinion,Dr. Malcolm Butler stated why having all persons wear acloth mask is the next best thing to a vaccine: “When aninfected person wears a mask (and remember that you aremost infectious before you even start to feel sick), the totalvolume of virus ﬂoating around in the air that we share isdramatically reduced... the simple act of wearing a mask isenough to stop the pandemic spread.\"12The virus must ﬁnda susceptible person, infect that person through a respira-tory, or possibly ocular, mucosal route and then be inenough concentration to overcome their defenses.It is important to realize that the person closest to aninfected individual may not be the most at risk. Air move-ment in a space may blow particles away from a close indi-vidual and towards another person further away.19Roomair turnover and ventilation are key to removing ﬂoatingaerosolized particles. Plexiglass between both masked andunmasked singers will catch some (but not all) droplets andmedium-sized particles with potential for aerosolization.Plexiglass will not mitigate disease transmission due to con-tinued aerosolization of the small and medium particles thatescape the sides of, or travel through, cloth masks, and theymay even disrupt airﬂow in a room’s ventilation patternwhich could lead to higher viral loads.20With many SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals beingasymptomatic, it is important for individuals who are olderor more susceptible to infection for other reasons, or wholive with someone who falls into those categories, to be cau-tious of asymptomatic, younger persons in individual andgroup settings. A recent publication on safer singing practi-ces reports how to mitigate risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmis-sion for singers.213. Lasting lung damage/ respiratory sequelae“Chi sa respirare, sa cantare,\" a phrase central to Bel Cantovoice pedagogy, states that “one who breathes well, singswell.\"22While it is true that one cannot ascribe all singingvoice problems to the breath, most pedagogues agree thatthe efﬁcient use of the breath is central to healthy phona-tion. If the respiratory system is compromised due to illnessor injury, singing can become more effortful, leading manyto use potentially injurious compensatory vocal strategies.Singers and teachers of singing are vocal athletes whodepend on optimal respiration.The risks of lung disease and the respiratory sequelae ofCOVID-19 may be underestimated. Prior to the currentpandemic, respiratory illness was remarkably common. In2017, the Global Burden of Disease Chronic RespiratoryDisease Collaborators estimated that 544.9 million peopleworldwide suffered disability and death due to chronic lungdisease.23Prevalence was highest (>10%−11% of the popu-lation) in wealthier countries, a ﬁnding consistent with theAmerican Lung Association’s estimate that over 35 millionAmericans suffer chronic, preventable, and possibly undiag-nosed lung disease.24Given that the population of theUnited States is roughly 331 million25people, this representsa one-in-ten risk for chronic respiratory disease prior toCOVID-19.COVID-19 is a new disease, and studies on its long-termeffects will continue to emerge. Many severe COVID-19infections require treatment in the intensive care unit andcan lead to lasting postrecovery sequelae26includingARTICLE IN PRESSLynn Helding, et al COVID-19 After Effects: Concerns for Singers 3\n",
    "breathing, physical, cognitive, and psychological prob-lems.27These symptoms are referred to as postintensive caresyndrome, an umbrella term for ICU sequelae that can havelong-term quality of life implications.28According to Mur-ray et al, about 50% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19will require some form of ongoing care to improve theirlong-term outcomes.29Respiratory changes following COVID-19 are often com-pared to SARS and MERS pandemics.30,31Chan et al stud-ied patients who recovered from SARS and found that 6%−20% suffered muscle weakness and mild-to-moderaterestrictive lung disease 6−8 weeks post discharge.32Inanother study, 94 SARS survivors (about a third of thestudy participants) presented with persistent pulmonaryfunction impairment at 1-year follow-up. The overall healthof these SARS survivors was also signiﬁcantly worse thanthe general population.33Hui et al studied the long-termeffects of SARS and found that 27.8% of patients hadabnormal chest radiograph ﬁndings and persisting reduc-tions in exercise capacity (6-minute walk test (6MWT)) at12 months.34Zhang et al reported that patients who recoverfrom SARS can experience persistent lung damage, even15 years later.35COVID-19 is not as deadly as SARS orMERS, and its symptomology is more heterogenous, affect-ing more diverse systems.36Nevertheless, it seems plausiblethat the respiratory sequelae of COVID-19 will resemblethose seen following these earlier pandemics.37Emerging studies are shaping our understanding of therespiratory effects of COVID-19. Carﬁet al found that87.4% of patients experienced at least 1 symptom followingrecovery, with fatigue (53%) and dyspnea/shortness ofbreath (43%) being the most commonly reported.38Wanget al studied patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumo-nia. Sixty-six of the 70 patients discharged (94%) had resid-ual disease on ﬁnal CT scans, with \"ground-glass\" opacitythe most common pattern. These lesions were dense clumpsof hardened tissue blocking blood vessels within and aroundthe alveoli.39It is important to note that these subjects werehospitalized, implying that they had severe COVID-19infections. These percentages may not be the same forpatients with more mild disease, and further study is needed.Nevertheless, reports summarized below suggest that respi-ratory sequelae may occur even following COVID-19 infec-tion in persons without severe symptoms.In another preliminary study, LeBorgne surveyed 55 pro-fessional Broadway, national tour, and cruise ship perform-ers who experienced COVID-19 symptom onset fromMarch 1−31, 2020.40Of these participants, roughly halftested positive for COVID-19 or COVID-19 antibodies, andhalf were unable to receive testing but had symptoms consis-tent with COVID-19 infection. Four percent were hospital-ized and 11% were asymptomatic but tested positive. Three-month post-acute virus, 28% of participants continued toexperience respiratory compromise, and 26% complained ofvocal fatigue. These early ﬁndings suggest that althoughthese elite artists survive the virus, many suffer lingeringreduction of respiratory and phonatory function.Surprisingly, one does not need to be seriously ill withCOVID-19 to suffer lung damage. A study by Long et alexamined 37 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Chest com-puted tomography (CT) scans of revealed lung abnormali-ties in 56.8% of these patients.41These included ground-glass opacities, stripe shadows and/or diffuse consolidationsimilar to those found by Wang et al.The pulmonary lesions associated with COVID-19 cancause chronic, long-lasting lung disease.42Some lesions willgradually heal or disappear, but many will harden intolayers of scar tissue called pulmonary ﬁbrosis, and the prev-alence of COVID-19 ﬁbrotic lung disease is predicted to behigh.43Pulmonary ﬁbrosis can stiffen the lungs, cause short-ness of breath, and limit the ability to be physically active.Whereas mild or moderate reductions in respiratory func-tion may not be debilitating for the average person, theycould be career-ending for singers and teachers of singing.4. Laryngeal and other nonrespiratory sequelaeGenerally speaking, a medical condition is consideredchronic if it lasts longer than 12 weeks. Thus, the array ofpost-COVID-19-related medical complications is just begin-ning to be elucidated. Beyond the respiratory/pulmonarycomplications described in detail above, other post COVID-19 medical conditions that affect vocal production mostdirectly can be grouped broadly into 4 categories: (1) Intu-bation and cough related injury; (2) Postviral vocal foldparalysis or paresis; (3) Postviral laryngeal sensory neuropa-thy; and (4) Chronic fatigue.4.1. Intubation and cough-related injuryThe nature and extent of intubation and/or cough-relatedinjury to the larynx and vocal folds associated withCOVID-19 is likely similar to other conditions that requireemergent and/or prolonged intubation. Thus, the prevalenceis estimated to be sharply increasing.44Chronic effects ofthese injuries include airway stenosis, laryngeal stenosisbelow, at, or above the vocal folds, vocal fold mucosal/vibration abnormalities and scarring, vocal fold ﬁxation,and postintubation phonatory insufﬁciency. While each ofthese conditions can occur with varying degrees of severity,even mild perturbations to precise laryngeal functioningmay lead to substantial functional compromise in singing.Additionally, the ability to restore full vocal function fol-lowing these types of injury is limited, at best.454.2. Postviral vocal fold paralysis or paresisVocal fold paralysis and paresis can result from even shortperiods of intubation, and also can result from viral-relatedinjury to the vagus nerve—one of twelve cranial nerves andthe one responsible for vocal fold muscle function and sen-sation to part of the larynx. Other conditions also may beresponsible for laryngeal nerve injury. While present under-standing is nascent, patients with lower cranial neuropathiespost COVID-19 including vagal nerve involvement haveARTICLE IN PRESS4Journal of Voice, Vol. &&, No. &&, 2020\n",
    "been reported.46−49Presumably, the incidence of vocal foldparalysis and paresis following COVID-19 infection appearslow given the prevalence of infection and the paucity ofreports. However, mild vocal fold paresis in singers oftenleads to symptoms that might not be noticed by the generalpopulation but would be noticed by trained singers andsinging teachers (such as vocal fatigue, effort, and rangeissues). Furthermore, access to comprehensive laryngologicevaluation, dynamic voice assessment, and strobovideolar-yngoscopy has been limited by pandemic. Thus, the preva-lence, severity and consequence of vocal fold paresis insingers post COVID-19 remain to be determined.4.3. Postviral laryngeal sensory neuropathyIn addition to the motor neuropathies described above, sen-sory neuropathies of the larynx are associated with viralinfections.50The most common presentations of laryngealsensory neuropathy are chronic cough and swallowing dys-function, yet much remains unknown about this elusive con-dition. Studies investigating high demand vocal function inpatients with sensory neuropathy of the larynx are lacking.The incidence and prevalence of laryngeal sensory neuropa-thy post COVID-19 is unknown but is likely to occur as itcan following any viral infection. It is logical to postulatethat loss of feeling and proprioception in the larynx couldlead to decrease in ﬁne motor control with adverse effectson singing capabilities, particularly among those whosework involves singing styles that demand exquisitely precisemotor movement.4.4. Chronic fatigueChronic fatigue is emerging as a common sequela ofCOVID-19 infection, and its importance for singers hasbeen recognized.51In several pilot studies over 53% of indi-viduals experienced chronic fatigue associated withCOVID-19.38,52While not directly affecting vocal produc-tion, chronic fatigue can be associated with voice com-plaints. This association has been reported speciﬁcally in astudy of younger singers,53and its symptoms typicallyworsen after physical, mental, or emotional exertion.54Chronic fatigue post COVID-19 may prove to be fairlycommon and, logically, may have a signiﬁcant impact onsingers with high vocal, mental, or emotional demands.5. Risk assessmentThis section contains risk assessment tools for singers andteachers of singing. These tools may assist the reader inmaking informed decisions about how, when, and wherethey will pursue singing in the months ahead.5.1. COVID-19 screening appThe authors suggest that readers make use of a smartphone-based screening app (eg, https://www.apple.com/covid19). Such an app can be used daily to evaluate one’scurrent health, in combination with a check of basaltemperature each morning before rising. Medical helpshould be sought immediately by anyone who suspects thathe/she might have COVID-19.5.2. Online COVID-19 survival calculatorSeveral online calculators are available to readers determinetheir chances of contracting and surviving COVID-19. Onenotable example can be found at: https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.comThis calculator gives the user a detailed summary of per-sonal risk and assists researchers by collecting data forfuture studies.5.3. Risk assessment toolRisk assessment can help estimate the likelihood of con-tracting COVID-19. Factors to be considered include a per-son’s age, place of residence, occupation, use of publictransit, extracurricular activities, travel history, the numberof persons with whom one interacts closely, and compliancewith CDC/WHO guidance on behavior. This informationcan be used to estimate one’s probability of harm. An exam-ple calculator application can be found at http://www.mycovid19risk.com/. The likelihood that complications mightresult if one contracted COVID-19 depends upon such fac-tors as age, pre-existing medical conditions, gender, ethnic-ity, and access to medical care. These factors help determineone’s magnitude of harm. The example provided above inSection ``Online survival calculator'' https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/calculator could be used to deter-mine magnitude of (potential) harm. Estimates ofprobability of harm and magnitude of harm can then becombined informally to help an individual determine his orher overall personal risk level.5.4. Decision assistance toolAs part of the National Association of Teachers of Singingwebinar, “After COVID—Concerns for Singers”(availableat https://youtu.be/xPg7FLkYDYY), the authors compileda singer-speciﬁc“decision assistance tool.”This tool(Figure 2 below) summarizes much of what we know aboutthe risks associated with COVID-19 and teaching singing.In general, “dose”multiplied by “exposure time”equals“risk of infection”:The risks of COVID-19 to all voice users are substantial.In addition to the multifold sequelae discussed in this article,the mental health, professional standing/employment, andﬁnances of those who contract this disease may be compro-mised. For some singers, these post-COVID-19 conditionsmay seem worse than dying itself. As shocking as this senti-ment may seem, musicians in one study who had lost theability to play their instrument due to injury described theemotional effects as “drastic,”“traumatic'' and “devastat-ing.”One musician stated, “it was almost like my life hadstopped”while another simply explained “music's myARTICLE IN PRESSLynn Helding, et al COVID-19 After Effects: Concerns for Singers 5\n",

The authorsbelieve that voice users should seriously consider the risks ofCOVID-19 sequelae outlined in this paper, recognizing thewarnings of physicians and other scientists that COVID-19infection in anyone of any age can be devastating or evenfatal.Conversely, there are those who are fearful of this illness,doing everything possible to avoid contracting it. Some maybe shamed into silence about expressing their fears of theworkplace and may need to cite their unwillingness to riskthe potential COVID-19 sequelae in an effort to come toan agreeable work arrangement with their employer. Realfears of being ﬁred or labeled as disloyal to their enterpriselikely play a signiﬁcant role in the potential avoidanceof this important conversation between employer andemployee. In many instances, the collaboration of a knowl-edgeable physician may be invaluable for the employee andemployer.CONCLUSIONIn assessing the risk of contracting COVID-19 illness,society must account for four, not three, possibilities. Inaddition to avoiding infection altogether, contractingand recovering unharmed, and contracting and dying,the fourth potential COVID-19 illness outcome—con-tracting and living with its potentially life and careeraltering after-effects—should play a prominent role inthe decisions voice users make as they consider returningto the workplace.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors certify that they have NO afﬁliations with orinvolvement in any organization or entity with any ﬁnancialinterest (such as honoraria; educational grants; participa-tion in speakers’bureaus; membership, employment, con-sultancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; andexpert testimony or patent-licensing arrangements) in thematerials (eg, websites) discussed in this manuscript\"\"\"\n",

    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite pulmonary impairments being the most prevalent, extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have now surpassed 57.8 million worldwide as of 22 November 2020. With estimated case fatality rates (number of deaths from COVID-19 divided by number of confirmed COVID-19 cases) varying between 1 and 7%, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients that may acquire a multitude of long-term health consequences. While the multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented, the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. In this review, we turn to previous similar coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV]) in combination with known health implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection to predict potential long-term effects of COVID-19, including pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematologic, renal, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, and psychosocial manifestations, in addition to the well-known post-intensive care syndrome. It is necessary to monitor COVID-19 patients after discharge to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. This can be accomplished by repurposing or initiating large cohort studies to not only focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also on acquired immune function as well as ethno-racial group and household income disparities in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. The future for COVID-19 survivors remains uncertain, and if this virus circulates among us for years to come, long-term effects may accumulate exponentially.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. First declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been over 57.8 million reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with the number of deaths surpassing 1.3 million as of 22 November 2020 [1]. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to host cells via binding of its spike (S) glycoprotein primarily to the human cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2] and the alternative receptor, cluster of differentiation 290 L (CD290L) [3], the same entry receptors as SARS-CoV-1 [4,5]. Rich in ACE2 receptors, epithelial cells of the nasal cavity and alveoli are the predominant entry sites for SARS-CoV-2. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, Zou et al. created a risk map of other organs susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 invasion based on ACE2 expression, which included the respiratory tract and lungs, as well as the heart, kidneys, intestine, and others [6]. Thus, while pulmonary impairments have been the most noted symptoms, literature describing extra-pulmonary effects of COVID-19 are abundant [7,8], the pathophysiology of which has been described in detail elsewhere [8]. Entry of SARS-COV-2 into cells via membrane fusion leads to downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent loss of their catalytic ability to degrade angiotensin II [9]. Some manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, such as pulmonary inflammation and coagulation, are thought to partly be due to enhanced angiotensin II effects [9]. These extra-pulmonary manifestations may be due to widespread dissemination and replication of SARS-CoV-2 due to direct viral toxicity or immunopathological consequences of the infection, including endothelial cell damage, thrombosis-associated inflammation, and immune response dysregulation (i.e. so-called “cytokine storm”) [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Johns Hopkins University, case-fatality rates (the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases) of COVID-19 patients generally varies between 1 and 7%, which strongly depends on several factors, including days since first confirmed case, testing efficacy, local pandemic response policies, and population age [10,11]. For example, in Italy, case fatality rates range from less than 3% in subjects younger than 60 years of age to more than 30% in subjects 80 years of age or older [12]. Thus, there will be a large population of recovered COVID-19 patients. While these patients have survived SARS-CoV-2 infection, some of the aftereffects may cause a significant impact on their health in the future. The multi-organ manifestations of COVID-19 are now well-documented [7,8,13], but the potential long-term implications of these manifestations remain to be uncovered. The United States alone has over 4.3 million confirmed cases [14], with a potential of over 40 million infections inferred from seroconversion studies [15]. By year end, it is likely the number of infected people will exceed 100 million. Thus, the number of people who may face a chronic complication from COVID-19 infection is staggering.\n",
    "\n",
    "As COVID-19 has not been with us long enough to estimate the majority of long-term adverse effects of infection, we need to turn to previous similar coronaviruses to try predicting long-term implications. The two most recent coronaviruses that have spread through the human population include SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-1 caused the 2002–2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, ensuing 8,098 cases, leading to 774 deaths by July 2003 [16]. MERS-CoV caused the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak that resulted in 866 deaths among 2,519 cases as of January 2020 [17].\n",
    "\n",
    "While COVID-19 appears to have greater infectivity and lower mortality compared to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, these previous coronaviruses exhibit similarities to SARS-CoV-2 [18], allowing knowledge of their long-term implications on the health of survivors to guide predictions of potential long-term effects of COVID-19. We urgently need data from long-term surveillance of COVID-19 patients to inform healthcare workers on how to monitor the health of survivors, provide early intervention that may provide benefit, and reduce the likelihood of overwhelming the medical system in the future due to subsequent health complications of many millions of patients. In the meantime, this review discusses various pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of what is known from previous coronaviruses to predict potential long-term health implications of COVID-19 (Figure 1). We intend to annually update this review from the rapidly emerging extensive literature.\n",

    "Figure 1. Potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential pulmonary and extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 are presented based on a review of documented long-term effects of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, as well as COVID-19 manifestations documented to date. The most notable potential long-term effects involve the central nervous system, psychosocial, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, renal, and gastrointestinal manifestations, as well as the post-intensive care syndrome.

    "Several studies have reported impaired exercise capacity and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in SARS-CoV-1 survivors ranging from 6 months to 15 years of follow-up [19–22], suggesting impairment of the intra-alveolar diffusion pathway. For example, a study of 110 survivors of SARS-CoV-1 infection reported minor abnormalities on chest radiograph, as well as lower exercise capacity and health status compared to a normal population at 6 months after symptom onset [22]. A 2-year follow-up study reported 52% of survivors of SARS-CoV-1 infection had persistent diffusing capacity impairment and reduced exercise capacity [19]. In a 15-year follow-up study of 71 patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-1, the greatest extent of recovery from pulmonary interstitial abnormalities and functional decline was within the first 2 years following infection, with 4.6% of patients having interstitial lung abnormalities after 15 years [23]. Similar long-term abnormalities have been reported for MERS-CoV, with 36% of patients who recovered from MERS-CoV experiencing abnormal chest radiographs, including lung fibrosis, ground-glass opacity, and pleural thickening, a median of 43 days after discharge [24]. Lastly, 1-year post-recovery of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffusing capacity appears to remain abnormal in up to 80% of patients, with 20% experiencing airflow obstruction and 20% exhibiting chest restriction [25]. Virus-induced immunopathological events are thought to contribute to the pulmonary manifestation of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV [26]. Specifically, these may include rapid virus replication that leads to greater cytopathic effects, predominant infection of alveolar epithelial cells (i.e. type I and II pneumocytes), and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn recruit fibroblasts and induce their differentiation into myofibroblasts [26,27]. Furthermore, the ability of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV to antagonize and subsequently delay interferon responses dysregulates the inflammatory response [26].\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of COVID-19, a meta-analysis of 31 articles and approximately 50,000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 reported that 29% of patients developed ARDS, 76% had double pneumonia, 20% had unilateral pneumonia, and 31% reported chest distress [28]. Specific pulmonary abnormalities included ground-glass opacities (70%), irregular lesions (54%), and bronchovascular bundle thickening (40%) [28]. All of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 included in a study by Wang et al. exhibited bilateral involvement of chest computerized tomography (CT) scan [29]. A study of 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia found chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients [30]. Abnormalities were found to rapidly evolve from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities [30]. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may develop irreversible fibrotic interstitial lung disease due to the persistence of chronic inflammation [31], although pulmonary function abnormalities may be reversible with time or treatments. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit excessive inflammatory damage due to a failed anti-inflammatory response and, subsequently, excessive proinflammatory cytokines that damage epithelial and endothelial cells of the lung [32]. Importantly, 54% of asymptomatic positive cases from the cruise ship Diamond Princess had lung opacities on CT [33], with a similar prevalence reported in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients in Italy [34]. Without prospective studies, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 on the lungs are not yet confirmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular manifestations\n",
    "Cardiovascular complications have been associated with MERS-CoV [35], SARS-CoV-1 [36–39], and pneumonia [40]. For example, a study of 121 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-1 infection (25% of patients with preexisting medical illness), reported the presence of cardiovascular complications, including hypotension (50.4% of patients), tachycardia (71.9%), bradycardia (14.9%), and cardiomegaly (10.7%) [38]. However, most complications returned to normal by 3 weeks after discharge except for tachycardia, which was still present in 35.5% of patients at 3 weeks [38]. Similarly, patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection were observed to have subclinical diastolic impairment without systolic involvement during acute infection, but impairment was reversible 30 days after clinical recovery [37].\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer follow-up studies suggest increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk following coronavirus infection, including a 12-year follow-up study reporting 68%, 44%, and 60% of patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection experienced persistent hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular system abnormalities, and glucose metabolism disorders, respectively [39]. Hospitalization from pneumonia may also be linked to long-term cardiovascular complications. A study of two large cohorts (the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort [n = 5,888, n = 591 pneumonia cases] and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study cohort [n = 15,792, n = 680 pneumonia cases]) reported that hospitalization for pneumonia was linked to increased CVD risk (i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke, and fatal coronary heart disease) 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 10 years (latter cohort only) after hospitalization [40]. Furthermore, hypertension and heart disease are among the highest risk factors for COVID-19, partly due to upregulated ACE2 on perivascular pericytes and cardiomyocytes in patients with these conditions [32]. Taken together, extensive literature supports the association between pulmonary infections and cardiovascular complications. While many cardiovascular manifestations appear to be reversible soon after infection, in general, these studies report increased cardiovascular risk post-infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 has also been associated with cardiovascular pathologies, including acute myocardial injury [41–44], cardiomyopathy [45], myocarditis [46], and arrhythmias [29,47,48]. A study of the first 41 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, reported myocardial injury in 5 patients, exhibiting increased high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration [41]. Two additional studies in Wuhan, China reported cardiac injury in 19.7% [42] and 27.8% [43] of 416 and 187 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, respectively. In a retrospective study of 68 fatal COVID-19 cases, myocardial damage alone and myocardial damage with respiratory failure was the cause of death in 7% and 33%, respectively [44]. A recent study from Germany examined 100 recovered COVID-19 patients by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging (negative swab and minimum 2 weeks since diagnosis; median of 71 days between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR) [49]. Cardiac involvement and ongoing myocardial inflammation were revealed in 78% and 60% of patients, respectively, independent of preexisting conditions [49]. While manifestations such as hypotension, cardiomegaly, and diastolic impairment may be largely reversible, hyperlipidemia and increased CVD risk may be evident years after infection. This is supported by the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cardiac complications and long-term follow-up studies of SARS-CoV-1 [39] and pneumonia [40] suggesting increased CVD risk. Interestingly, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to have a syndrome resembling Kawasaki disease [50], which has subsequently been named as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere [51–55]. Briefly, MIS-C often develops 4–6 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection and exhibits multisystem involvement with clinical features, including fever, a hyperinflammatory state, cutaneous manifestations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and organ dysfunction [52]. However, the cardiovascular manifestations are most notable, including symptomatic myocarditis in 40–80% of patients, coronary artery abnormalities in 9–24% of patients, as well as pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and vascular regurgitation [52]. Potential long-term sequalae of this disease are currently unknown [55].\n",

    "Hematologic manifestations and thrombotic complications have been associated with SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (reviewed in [56]). Numerous studies have reported associations between SARS-CoV-1 and lymphopenia [57–62], leukopenia [58,60,61], thrombocytopenia [57,58,61,62], and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) [62]. SARS-CoV-1 infection has also been associated with fetal complications due to dysfunction of the placental circulation, which may be attributed to intervillous and subchorionic fibrin deposition, as well as avascular and fibrotic villi formation [63]. Although data is relatively scarce, MERS-CoV has been associated with hematologic manifestations and thrombotic complications, including thrombocytopenia [64,65] and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [66,67].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar associations have quickly become apparent with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several hematologic manifestations show negative prognostic value in COVID-19 patients, including lymphopenia [41,48,68–71], leukocytosis [68,70], thrombocytopenia [41,48,68,69,72], and coagulopathy (elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen) [68–70,73–78]. Coagulopathy has become a prominent feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly manifesting as a pro-thrombotic state, including venous and arterial thrombosis [79,80]. Thrombotic complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection were first reported in China [81] and the Netherlands [82] in up to 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients. Despite receiving thromboprophylaxis, a high incidence of thrombotic complications (primarily thromboembolic events) have been reported [82–87]. DIC [76] and microthrombi events [88,89] have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. Specifically, postmortem analysis showed alveolar capillary microthrombi to be 9 times more common in patients who died of COVID-19 compared to those who died of influenza [88].\n",
    "\n",
    "Although hematologic manifestations have been extensively reported in COVID-19 and similar conditions, the potential for long-term hematologic morbidity remains unknown. Coagulopathy may be caused by a hyperinflammatory state, pro-thrombotic factors, and/or endotheliitis [90–93]. If these environments persist, then so to can thrombotic complications. Furthermore, increased ACE2 expression in endothelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection may perpetuate thromboinflammation [88]. However, it was recently found that treatment of COVID-19 patients with low molecular weight heparin has favorable therapeutic potential [94].\n",
    "\n",
    "Renal manifestations\n",
    "Acute renal impairment was reported in patients with SARS-CoV-1 infection and, more recently, in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. A study of 536 patients with SARS-CoV-1 reported 6.7% developed acute kidney injury (AKI) 5–48 days after onset of viral infection [95]. Of these patients, 91.7% died, which was significantly higher than the mortality rate in SARS-CoV-1 patients without renal impairment (8.8%). AKI has been reported with a higher incidence in COVID-19 patients compared to those infected with SARS-CoV-1, including 0.5–29% of patients with COVID-19 in China [68–70,96] and 37% in the United States, with 14% requiring dialysis [97]. Additionally, a meta-analysis including over 13,000 patients with COVID-19 reported the prevalence of AKI to be 17% [98]. Other renal impairments reported in COVID-19 patients include hematuria, reported in nearly half of COVID-19 patients [97], and proteinuria, reported in up to 87% of critically ill patients with COVID-19 [74]. However, studies have yet to describe long-term renal impairment in patients with coronavirus infection, perhaps due to the high mortality rate in those who develop kidney injury [95].\n",
    "\n",
    "Central nervous system manifestations\n",
    "SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have both been reported to associate with polyneuropathy [99,100], encephalitis [101,102], and stroke [103,104]. Likewise, COVID-19 has been associated with polyneuropathy [105,106], encephalitis [105,107], and stroke [105,108,109], with common central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, including hyposmia, headaches, weakness, and altered consciousness [29,105]. A retrospective review of clinical, radiological, laboratory, and neuropathological data of 43 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 identified 10 cases of transient encephalopathies, 12 cases of inflammatory CNS syndromes, 8 cases of ischemic stroke, and 8 cases of peripheral neurological disorders [110]. SARS-CoV-2 can penetrate the CNS, potentially via the systemic circulation by damaging the capillary endothelium to gain access to the brain or via the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb (reviewed in [111]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have reported persistence of RNA from various coronaviruses in the CNS following the acute phase of infection, causing neuronal loss (reviewed in [111]). One or a combination of direct viral encephalitis, systemic inflammation, peripheral organ dysfunction, and/or cerebrovascular changes put COVID-19 survivors at risk of developing long-term neurological consequences [112]. Evidently, at discharge, one-third of COVID-19 patients exhibit cognitive impairment and motor deficits [113]. The pronounced systemic inflammation apparent in SARS-CoV-2 infection [41], and the fact that systemic inflammation promotes cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease [114–116], suggests that COVID-19 survivors will likely experience long-term neurodegeneration. Furthermore, chronic ventilation is highly associated with persistent cognitive decline, executive dysfunction, and reduced quality of life (reviewed in [117]). Nevertheless, longitudinal follow-up studies are required to determine long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to understand its neuroinvasion properties. Given the already significant burden of neurodegeneration in the aging population, the possibility of COVID-19 causing neurodegeneration is alarming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gastrointestinal manifestations\n",
    "Patients infected with SARS-CoV-1 have been reported to present with gastrointestinal [118], hepatic [119], and pancreatic [120] involvement. Similarly, reported gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19 include anorexia, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding [121–123]. The isolation of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles from fecal matter [69,124] and intestinal mucosal damage observed by endoscopy [125] further supports the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to exist, replicate, and infect the gastrointestinal tract. Hepatic involvement, including liver damage, has been noted in COVID-19, with elevated alanine and aspartate aminotransferases [29,126]. Acute hepatitis with severe liver damage presenting prior to typical symptoms of COVID-19 has also been reported [127]. Biopsy analyses have revealed pathological features of hepatic injury, including mild lobular and portal inflammation as well as moderate microvascular stenosis [128]. Pancreatic manifestations of COVID-19 have also been reported, including elevated lipase and amylase [129,130] as well as acute pancreatitis [131,132]. However, long-term surveillance studies are required to determine if gastrointestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic manifestations can persist after acute infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-Intensive care syndrome (PICS)\n",
    "Up to 80% of ICU patients who survive acute respiratory failure after receiving mechanical ventilation report worsened physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that persist beyond discharge, termed post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) (Figure 2) [133]. In the United States, on 2 December 2020, there are 100,226 patients currently hospitalized with COVID-19, 19,396 of which have been admitted to ICU and 6,855 of which are currently on a ventilator [134]. ICU-admitted COVID-19 patients may have additional long-term effects on top of those due to the viral infection alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2. Post-intensive care syndrome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) can occur in ICU patients who survive COVID-19 and includes worsened physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that persist beyond discharge. Several factors contribute to these impairments, including sedatives, neuromuscular blocking drugs, immobility, mechanical ventilation, as well as reduced human interaction and reduced access to rehabilitation service. Several impairments can result, including cognitive impairment (e.g. memory loss, attention deficit), physical impairment (e.g. muscle wasting and weakness, diaphragm dysfunction), and mental health implications (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD). COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ICU, intensive care unit; PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2.\n",

    "Physical impairments, including joint contractures, substantial muscle wasting and weakness, and physical functioning limitations, may last for months to years [135]. The risk of physical impairments increases with the use of critical care management, including deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking drugs, and associated immobility [136]. Furthermore, long periods of mechanical ventilation make patients prone to muscle atrophy and weakness [137], and may result in diaphragm dysfunction, laryngeal injury, dysphagia, and dysphonia [138]. Cognitive impairments, including memory, attention, and executive function, commonly occur and persist in patients after ICU admission [136]. For example, in a study of 821 patients admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure or shock, 40% and 26% had global cognition scores similar to patients with moderate traumatic brain injury and patients with mild Alzheimer’s disease, respectively [139]. Another long-term risk of ICU admission is delirium, which is a state of confused thinking that can result in long-term cognitive impairment [137]. This can be caused by the virus targeting the brain and/or sedatives prescribed to reduce coughing and reduce the discomfort of a breathing tube [137]. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced human interaction during ICU admission, including with family or healthcare staff, and potentially reduced access to rehabilitation services and spiritual care may increase one’s risk of long-term cognitive impairment [136]. Some potential ways to limit this risk is daily interruption of sedatives to determine whether patients still require this medication and reduced ventilator use early in the course of disease [137]. Mental health impairments, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) commonly occur in survivors of the ICU. For example, in a 5-year follow-up study of 196 patients with ARDS admitted to the ICU, 38%, 32%, and 23% of patients reported prolonged anxiety, depression, and PTSD, respectively [140].\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction of physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments can lead to reduced quality of life and chronic fatigue. As part of the ARDSNet Long-Term Outcomes Study, 70% and 66% of ARDS survivors reported fatigue at 6 and 12 months, respectively [141]. Furthermore, returning to work following a critical illness has shown to be challenging, with 49% and 17% of 117 SARS-CoV-1 survivors from Toronto, Ontario not returning to work after 3 and 12 months, respectively [142]. A meta-analysis of 52 studies on returning to work after critical illness, including ARDS, reported 60% of patients returning to work after 12 months, with post-hospital impairments, including mental health, being a risk factor for delayed return to work [143]. Taken together, it is important to implement evidence-based critical care interventions and rehabilitation programs for recovered COVID-19 patients that continue after discharge to minimize the long-term effects of ICU admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychosocial manifestations\n",
    "Another important consideration of long-term effects of COVID-19 is the mental health impact to survivors, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD, even for those not admitted to the ICU, as well as somatic symptoms, including sleep disturbances and chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (Figure 3) [144]. Long-term effects of SARS-CoV-1 included widespread chronic pain, fatigue, psychological distress, and disturbed sleep that contributed to failure to return to productive work at least 1 year after acute illness [145]. A study of SARS-CoV-1 survivors in Hong Kong reported clinical diagnoses of PTSD (55%), depression (39%), pain disorder (36%), panic disorder (33%), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (16%) at 31–50 months post-infection, a substantial increase from the pre-infection psychiatric diagnosis prevalence of 3% [146]. Another study of 195 SARS-CoV-1 patients, reported 10–18% of patients exhibited symptoms related to PTSD, anxiety, and depression, with greater symptom severity among those with high perceived life threat and low emotional support [147]. Similarly, a study of 117 survivors from Toronto, Ontario found that at 1-year follow-up, 33% of patients reported a significant decrease in mental health and there were a total of 668 visits from 51 patients to psychiatry or psychology practitioners [142]. These patients reported potential stressors as social stigmatization, loss of anonymity through the media, death of family and coworkers, inability to attend funeral services, emotional strain of quarantine and isolation, overwhelming fear for their physical health, and concern of transmitting the virus to loved ones [142]. Loss of work can be a significant contributor to impaired mental health following SARS infection. A study of SARS-CoV-1 survivors reporting only 78% returned to full-time work after 2 years [19]. While current data on the mental health and somatic symptom impact of COVID-19 are scarce, a study of 714 hospitalized but stable COVID-19 patients reported post-traumatic stress symptoms in 96% of patients [148] and a study of 57 COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher prevalence of depression (29% v. 9.8%), but not anxiety, compared to participants in quarantine [149].\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3. Psychosocial manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 can have a substantial impact on the mental health of survivors, including anxiety, depression, PTSD, OCD, panic disorder, and chronic pain. Furthermore, somatic manifestations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection can include sleep disturbances and chronic fatigue. Potential stressors that may cause these manifestations include death of family and coworkers, inability to attend funeral services due to gathering limitations, loss of work, concern of transmitting the virus to loved ones, emotional strain from quarantine and isolation, social stigmatization, loss of anonymity from the media, and high perceived life threat.

    "A multidisciplinary approach focused on long-term rehabilitation, particularly for psychiatric and fatigue morbidities, as well as functional and occupational rehabilitation, is needed. Researchers are beginning to investigate a mobile app that can promote mindfulness and coping skills for discharged patients [137].\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical laboratory testing\n",
    "Laboratory testing plays a critical role in several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including initial diagnosis by molecular testing of upper and lower respiratory tract specimens or identification of past infection by serology testing of plasma, serum, or whole blood samples [150]. In addition to diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance, the clinical laboratory can also aid in assessing disease severity and risk stratification. Firstly, inflammatory biomarkers can aid in assessing disease severity, including proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-6 [IL-6] and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α]), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ferritin, and procalcitonin [151–154]. Various hematologic markers have also been found to have prognostic value, including for predicting DIC (e.g. lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, prothrombin time [PT], aPTT) [71,151]. In terms of cardiovascular and renal manifestations, cardiac troponin measurement has been associated with ICU admission and in-hospital mortality [42–44] and creatinine measurement has been associated with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation [96]. However, further studies are needed to guide the use of biomarkers for predicting long-term implications of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead\n",
    "COVID-19 has simply not been with us long enough to decipher its long-lasting effects on infected patients. The adverse effects apparent during COVID-19 infection are widespread. In addition to those described above, these include persistent symptoms (e.g. fatigue, dyspnea, joint pain, chest pain) [155], as well as bone (e.g. femoral head necrosis) [23], ocular (e.g. conjunctivitis, retinal changes) [69], and dermatologic (e.g. erythematous rash, urticaria) [156] manifestations. Continued monitoring of COVID-19 patients after discharge is necessary to understand the breadth and severity of long-term effects. It is therefore important to repurpose or initiate large cohort studies to focus on the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection to not only understand acquired immune function, but also the long-term impact on pulmonary function, the cardiovascular system, hematologic parameters, renal function, and many others. To achieve this, cohort studies have already begun pivoting to focus on the short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19. For example, the Rhineland Study, which was initiated in 2016 to study neurodegenerative disorders has switched its focus to COVID-19 to help address questions including whether SARS-Cov-2 contributes to increased long-term health risks [157]. These large cohort studies may also shed light on similarities and differences between populations, including potential preexisting immunity advantages. Particularly, special attention should be given to visible minorities who have proven to be the most vulnerable among the general population [158–160]. For example, the City of Toronto collected ethno-racial group and household income data between 20 May 2020 and 16 July 2020 and reported drastic disparities in both areas [160]. Eighty-three percent of reported COVID-19 cases and 71% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients identified with a racialized group, including Arab, Middle Eastern, West Asian, Black, Latin American, South Asian, Indo-Caribbean, and Southeast Asian people. This contrasts with only 52% of Toronto’s population identifying with a racialized group. Conversely, 17% of COVID-19 cases occurred in White patients, while 48% of Toronto’s population identifies as White. In terms of household income, 27% and 6% of COVID-19 cases were from those in the lowest and highest income bracket, respectively, while 14% and 21% of Toronto’s population is made up of people from these respective brackets. Recommendations for healthcare professionals on how to appropriately and comprehensively monitor the health status of patients who have recovered from COVID-19, such as those provided by Balachandar et al. [161], are needed to manage the physical, social, and psychological impact of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. The road to recovery after COVID-19 is yet untraveled and it is critical to understand this journey to prevent overwhelming the medical system from subsequent health complications of potentially millions of patients.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "Human/virus interactions have been known since the emergence of our species. Approximately 8% of our genome consists of viral gene sequences permanently embedded in our code, indicating extensive co-evolutionary crosstalk. While directly implicated in tumorigenesis, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration, the full repertoire of the long-term effects of viral infections on human health remains largely underappreciated. Here, we reviewed the current literature on the long-term sequalae of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and what is known thus far in regard to SARS-CoV-2, mostly in adults. While most studies mentioned focused on a single population of infected patients at their hospital, a heterogeneous population was considered in this review by taking all studies into account, including numerous countries, preexisting co-morbidities, disease severity, time to follow-up, treatment regimens, and more. It should also be noted that most studies included in this review included symptomatic COVID-19 patients, as the elucidation of long-term complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients is limited. However, a weaker immune response, including lower cytokine levels, has been reported in asymptomatic compared to symptomatic COVID-19 patients [162], which may suggest milder multi-system involvement and long-term manifestations since inflammation and a dysregulated immune response are thought to be key drivers. Consequences of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is an important area for future research, as these subjects may be unaware of their past infection and subsequently be much less likely to be monitored for long-term sequalae. The severity of the current pandemic and the multitude of health consequences induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection highlight the need for a more systematic and in-depth characterization of the life-long effects of viral infections.\"\"\"\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with multiple neurological complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). While there are reports of COVID-19 -related GBS cases, much remain unknown. We report two cases of GBS-associated COVID-19, which started about eight weeks after the initial COVID-19 infection. Such a long duration between infection and symptom onset of GBS is unusual for post-infectious GBS. Moreover, severely ill patients with COVID-19 may have prolonged hospital stay leading to critical illness myoneuropathy. Diagnosing superimposed GBS can be challenging in such cases. Clinical suspicion, nerve conduction studies with electromyography, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis can help in making the correct diagnosis. Both presented cases responded to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "In December of 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged, infecting millions of people worldwide and causing significant morbidity and mortality to the affected individuals [1]. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with various neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) [1-4].\n",
    "\n",
    "GBS is a rare autoimmune inflammatory neuropathy with a varied clinical spectrum [5]. The classic form of GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), presents with ascending weakness, sensory deficits, and loss of deep tendon reflexes [5,6]. It can also present as pure motor, pure sensory, and pharyngeal-cervical-brachial variants, along with Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) with cranial nerve involvement [5,6]. Electrophysiologic studies can further characterize GBS as AIDP, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) [5,6].\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous reports have shown that several viral (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis E virus, and Zika virus) and bacterial (campylobacter jejuni and mycoplasma pneumoniae) infections can trigger an aberrant immune response attacking the peripheral nerves, leading to GBS [5,6]. Additionally, GBS has been reported in patients with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [7]. While there are some case reports and case series with COVID-19-related GBS, there is a knowledge gap and the entire clinical spectrum of COVID-19-related GBS remains unknown [1,8]. Here we report two cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 to highlight some critical clinical features and diagnostic challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Presentation\n",
    "Case 1\n",
    "A 32-year-old man with no relevant medical history presented with hypoxia, tachypnea, and fever from COVID-19 which was confirmed by RNA PCR test. He was admitted to the medical ICU and developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He received tocilizumab (single dose), hydroxychloroquine (three-day course), and remdesivir (100mg 14-day course). His ventilation requirements continued to increase and ultimately, he required veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. He spent 60 days in the ICU, which was further complicated by a gastrointestinal bleed. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the prolonged ICU stay, he was deconditioned and had a significant generalized weakness. He began to work with physical therapy and was able to walk with an assistive device. Over the next five days, he noted paresthesia in his lower extremities along with a progression in weakness, eventually requiring two-person assist to ambulate. Neurological examination revealed atrophy of anterior and posterior compartment leg muscles and 1/5 strength in ankle dorsi and plantarflexion. Proximal strength was preserved, and he did not have any facial weakness. Sensation to light touch was intact and vibration sensation was mildly decreased. Reflexes were 2+ at upper extremities, brisk at the patella bilaterally, and absent at the ankles. While there was a concern for a critical illness myoneuropathy, the clinical presentation, including lack of proximal weakness, sudden deterioration in motor strength, and new onset sensory neuropathy while recovering were atypical [9-11]. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCSs) showed severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy with ongoing denervation changes consistent with a diagnosis of acute motor sensory axonal neuropathy, a variant of GBS (Figure 1). Comprehensive workup revealed normal B1, B6, B12, ANA <1:80, negative for Hepatitis B and HIV, normal SPEP, UPEP, negative for GM1 and GD1a/b antibodies. CSF analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation with four nucleated cells and protein of 127.6 mg/dL, further confirming the diagnosis.\n",

    "A 61-year-old man with known diabetes with no pre-existing neuropathy, severe lumbar stenosis (L4-L5), and right foot drop at baseline, presented with two days of generalized weakness and diarrhea and was positive for COVID-19 (RNA PCR). Shortly after admission, he went into acute respiratory failure requiring intubation. He also received a dose of tocilizumab for COVID-19 after intubation. He had a prolonged ICU course of over seven weeks which was complicated by aspiration pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and critical illness myoneuropathy. He was extubated and his medical issues stabilized. He was discharged to acute rehabilitation facility 60 days after initial admission but there he developed new-onset leg weakness, gait instability, and soon after his hands were involved. He was readmitted with increasing weakness. Neurological examination revealed atrophy of intrinsic hand and foot muscles. He had mild proximal upper extremity weakness, with 2/5 strength in ankle dorsi and plantarflexion. Vibration sensation was absent at the great toes and patella, and he was areflexic. His EMG/NCSs showed a severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy (Figure 2). CSF analysis showed no nucleated cell and mild elevation of protein to 54 mg/dL (normal: 15-45 mg/dl). He also was negative for Hepatitis B in addition to HIV and had a normal SPEP, normal vitamin B12, and no ganglioside antibodies. He responded to a course of IVIg therapy with improvement in his strength, with improvement in proximal upper extremity strength (4+) as well as distal strength (improvement in ankle strength). He was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation where he continued therapy for improving his strength (Table 1).\n",

    "Discussion\n",
    "GBS can be associated with COVID-19 [1-4,8,9]. Many patients with GBS present with an antecedent infection. The majority of GBS cases associated with COVID-19 had typical AIDP pattern, consisting of a sensorimotor, primarily demyelinating GBS. AMSAN variants are relatively rare (<15% of all reported cases). Most patients present with symptoms roughly nine days after onset of COVID-19 [1,8]. However, our patients developed GBS about eight weeks after the initial symptoms of COVID-19, which is atypical. Moreover, both of them were affected by critical illness myopathy/neuropathy, further making the diagnosis challenging. Interestingly, one of the patients retained reflexes which is unusual for GBS but can be seen in a small percentage of patients [5,6].\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to differentiate the causes of acute to subacute new-onset weakness in patients with COVID-19. In severe cases of the disease, patients may have prolonged hospital courses with significant intensive care unit stays. This can result in critical illness myopathy (CIM) and critical illness polyneuropathy (CIPN), and these conditions may present together. The pathophysiology of CIM is thought to be secondary to an inflammatory cascade due to microvascular, metabolic, and electrical alterations with atrophy due to increase muscle proteolysis with decrease in muscle protein synthesis [10]. Creatinine kinase can be elevated in these patients, and they often present with symmetric proximal muscle weakness which was not seen in these cases. CIPN can present with diminished reflexes, weakness, or paresthesia. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is a frequent underlying factor for CIPN [11]. The pathophysiology of CIPN is likely from injury to the microcirculation of distal nerves, resulting in ischemia and axonal degeneration. CSF analysis in CIPN usually does not show albumino-cytological dissociation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiating between CIPN/CIM and GBS can be nuanced and complicated, and as discussed above, CSF studies and EMG/NCS can be used to provide diagnostic evidence. However, sometimes, NCS/EMG alone may not be able to confidently differentiate between CIPN and axonal variant of GBS [5,11-14]. In a small percentage of cases reflexes can be intact in axonal variants of GBS. In such cases, a critical review of the clinical presentation, and CSF analysis can be helpful [12-14]. It is critically important to try and parse out these two diagnoses as there are treatment options available for GBS which can lead to improved clinical outcomes. At this point, there is no approved therapy for CIPN/CIM [12-14].\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "GBS associated with COVID-19 can have a delayed onset. These cases are unique to currently published literature in their delayed clinical presentation. Moreover, in critically ill patients from COVID-19 with CIM/CIPN, diagnosis of GBS can be challenging. Clinical suspicion along with thorough EMG/NCSs and CSF analysis can help in making the correct diagnosis and initiation of appropriate intervention. With the cases of patients infected with SARS-COV-2 rising, it is prudent to remain vigilant to assess for possible treatable causes of neurological deficits in patients. While conditions such as CIM/CIPN have no current treatment, GBS, including atypical versions, can be treated with improvement in clinical outcomes.\"\"\"\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "As time has passed since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, it has become\n",
    "increasingly apparent that a subset of infected individuals develop long-term complications.\n",
    "Physicians continue to report their observations of case studies in patients who seem unable to\n",
    "recover from COVID-19, including long-term symptoms such as shortness of breath, weakness,\n",
    "brain fog, and fatigue1–5. Longitudinal studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have found that\n",
    "74-88% had symptoms lasting longer than 50-80 days, most commonly fatigue and dyspnea\n",
    "(difficulty breathing)6,7. Longitudinal followup studies with quantitative phenotyping have started\n",
    "to elucidate the long-term sequelae in severe cases. For example, serial CT scans in\n",
    "hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed progression and continuation of lung abnormalities up\n",
    "to 24 days from onset of illness8\n",
    ". Similarly, a study using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)\n",
    "imaging in COVID-19 patients showed that 78% had abnormal findings 2-3 months after the\n",
    "onset of COVID-199\n",
    ", and another study found that up to 40% of COVID-19 patients presented\n",
    "with pericarditis or myocarditis >70 days post-infection10. New and permanent loss of kidney\n",
    "function has also been reported in COVID-19 patients 11\n",
    ".\n",
    "While there have been many case reports of the most severe forms of COVID-19, the majority\n",
    "of the population does not develop symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization. It is\n",
    "known that there is a spectrum of initial response to infection, ranging from asymptomatic\n",
    "individuals, to those with only a few minor symptoms who stay home, and up to those who are\n",
    "hospitalized. For many people throughout this spectrum, the symptoms linger, and new\n",
    "symptoms may arise well after the initial onset. There is an ongoing grassroots effort among\n",
    "these COVID-19 “long-haul” patients and their advocates to collect and share the details of\n",
    "long-term symptoms12,13, which together have uncovered a high incidence of long-term fatigue,\n",

    "With more than 30 million documented infections and 1 million deaths worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues unabated. The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 2 infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening and fatal disease. Current estimates are that approximately 20 million people globally have “recovered”; however, clinicians are observing and reading reports of patients with persistent severe symptoms and even substantial end-organ dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because COVID-19 is a new disease, much about the clinical course remains uncertain—in particular, the possible long-term health consequences, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epidemiology\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there is no consensus definition of postacute COVID-19. Based on the COVID Symptom Study, in which more than 4 million people in the US, UK and Sweden have entered their symptoms after a COVID-19 diagnosis, postacute COVID-19 is defined as the presence of symptoms extending beyond 3 weeks from the initial onset of symptoms and chronic COVID-19 as extending beyond 12 weeks.1 It is possible that individuals with symptoms were more likely to participate in this study than those without them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously described, a postacute syndrome is well recognized in patients who are recovering from a serious illness, in particular an illness that required hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit. In a 2016 study among 43 patients who had been discharged after intensive care unit stay (46% required mechanical ventilation), 36 (84%) reported impairment in cognition, mental health, or physical function that persisted for 6 to 12 months beyond hospital discharge, collectively known as post–intensive care syndrome.2 In a study from Italy that assessed COVID-19 symptom persistence among 143 patients discharged from the hospital, only 18 patients (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19–related symptoms after a mean of 60 days after initial symptom onset.3\n",
    "\n",
    "However, postacute COVID-19 syndrome is not just observed among patients who had severe illness and were hospitalized. In a telephone survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among a random sample of 292 adults (≥18 years) who had a positive outpatient test result for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, 35% of 274 symptomatic respondents reported not having returned to their usual state of health 2 weeks or more after testing, including 26% among those aged 18-34 years (n = 85), 32% among those aged 35-49 years (n = 96), and 47% among those aged 50 years or older (n = 89).4 Older than 50 years and the presence of 3 or more chronic medical conditions were associated with not returning to usual health within 14 to 21 days after receiving a positive test result. Notwithstanding, 1 in 5 individuals aged 18-34 years without chronic medical conditions had not yet achieved baseline health when interviewed at a median of 16 days from the testing date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manifestations\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly reported symptoms after acute COVID-19 are fatigue and dyspnea. Other common symptoms include joint pain and chest pain.3 In addition to these general symptoms, specific organ dysfunction has been reported, involving primarily the heart, lungs, and brain. From a pathogenesis standpoint, these complications could be the consequence of direct tissue invasion by the virus (possibly mediated by the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor), profound inflammation and cytokine storm, related immune system damage, the hypercoagulable state described in association with severe COVID-19, or a combination of these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular\n",
    "\n",
    "Myocardial injury, as defined by an increased troponin level, has been described in patients with severe acute COVID-19, along with thromboembolic disease. Myocardial inflammation and myocarditis, as well as cardiac arrhythmias, have been described after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a German study of 100 patients who recently recovered from COVID-19, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (performed a median of 71 days after COVID-19 diagnosis) revealed cardiac involvement in 78% and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60%.5 The presence of chronic comorbidities, duration and severity of acute COVID-19 illness, and time since original diagnosis did not correlate with these findings. However, the sample was not random and likely biased toward patients with cardiac findings. Nevertheless, among 26 competitive college athletes who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, none of whom required hospitalization and the majority without reported symptoms, 12 (46%) had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging routinely performed for positive testing results (range, 12-53 days later).6 The durability and consequences of such imaging findings are not yet known and longer follow-up is needed. However, an increased incidence of heart failure as a major sequela of COVID-19 is of concern, with considerable potential implications for the general population of older adults with multimorbidity, as well as for younger previously healthy patients, including athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulmonary\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study of 55 patients with COVID-19, at 3 months after discharge, 35 (64%) had persistent symptoms and 39 (71%) had radiologic abnormalities consistent with pulmonary dysfunction such as interstitial thickening and evidence of fibrosis.7 Three months after discharge, 25% of patients had decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. In another study of 57 patients, abnormalities in pulmonary function test results obtained 30 days after discharge, including decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and diminished respiratory muscle strength, were common and occurred in 30 patients (53%) and 28 patients (49%), respectively.8 If compounded on cardiovascular comorbidity, either preexisting or incident from COVID-19, persistent decline in lung function could have major adverse cardiopulmonary consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurologic\n",
    "\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 can penetrate brain tissue via viremia and also by direct invasion of the olfactory nerve, leading to anosmia. To date, the most common long-term neurologic symptoms after COVID-19 are headache, vertigo, and chemosensory dysfunction (eg, anosmia and ageusia). Although stroke is a serious albeit uncommon consequence of acute COVID-19, encephalitis, seizures, and other conditions such as major mood swings and “brain fog” have been reported up to 2 to 3 months after initial illness onset.9 Past pandemics involving viral pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS], and influenza) have involved neuropsychiatric sequelae that could linger for months in “recovered” patients, which can seriously threaten cognitive health, overall well-being, and day-to-day functional status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emotional Health and Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to symptom persistence and clinical sequelae that may last far beyond the initial COVID-19 illness, the extent of emotional and behavioral concerns and general distress for those affected has yet to be determined. A diagnosis of COVID-19, and subsequent need for physical distancing, has been associated with feelings of isolation and loneliness.10 COVID-19–related stigma has also become pervasive and can result in a sense of hopelessness. Increasing reports of lingering malaise and exhaustion akin to chronic fatigue syndrome may leave patients with physical debility and emotional disturbance. Compounded by the psychological toll of the pandemic experienced population wide, individuals recovering from COVID-19 may be at even greater risk of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorder. These combined effects have the potential to result in a global health crisis, considering the sheer number of COVID-19 cases worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Granted that no long-term data of substantial numbers of patients with various presenting symptoms exist and with comparison groups, and that it is still early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that large numbers of patients will experience long-term sequelae. Outpatient post–COVID-19 clinics are opening in many localities where large outbreaks have occurred, and the term “long-haulers” has been suggested to refer to these patients. It is imperative that the care of this vulnerable patient population take a multidisciplinary approach, with a thoughtfully integrated research agenda, to avoid health system fragmentation and to allow the comprehensive study of long-term health consequences of COVID-19 on multiple organ systems and overall health and well-being. Furthermore, such an approach will provide the opportunity to efficiently and systematically conduct studies of therapeutic interventions to mitigate the adverse physical and mental health effects among hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who recover from COVID-19. Longer-ranging longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials will be critical to elucidate the durability and depth of health consequences attributable to COVID-19 and how these may compare with other serious illnesses.\"\"\"\n",

    "Background\n",

    "Methods\n",
    "Patients aged ≥18 years with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 who were hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, in the period from March 11 to May 15 were offered follow-up after hospitalization. On admission, a comprehensive symptom and medical history was collected, including demographic characteristics, duration of symptoms, comorbidities, and concomitant medications. At discharge, patients were offered follow-up consultations—either by telephone or at an in-person visit—at 6 and 12 weeks at our post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic to assess whether symptoms present at admission had resolved.\n",

    "Results\n",
    "During the inclusion period, 71 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Of these, 10 patients died, 3 were transferred to another region, 4 declined to participate, and 5 were lost to follow-up before the 12-week evaluation. Thus, 49 patients were included. Overall, 96% reported 1 or more persisting symptoms at 12-week follow-up. The main symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, cough, chemosensory dysfunction, and headache.\n",

    "As of January 6, 2021, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has infected more than 86 million individuals globally, spread across 191 countries, causing more than 1 million related deaths [1]. In Denmark, 3 979 917 individuals have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 as of January 6, 2021. Of those, 172 779 individuals tested positive, 142 057 have recovered from infection, and 1420 (0.8%) individuals have died of COVID-19 [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "The variation in symptomatology and severity during hospitalization with COVID-19 quickly became known during the first wave of the pandemic. The clinical features ranges from being asymptomatic to having severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure with need of intensive care treatment [3–5]. Emerging data suggest that COVID-19 can result in long-term symptoms from several organ systems in a subgroup of individuals recovering from acute infection. The primary reported long-term symptoms include cognitive impairment, fatigue, chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and impaired smell and taste [6–8]. These findings raise important major questions about the long-term health consequences of COVID-19. Thus, we are in urgent need of more evidence about the duration of organ-specific symptoms and complications that appear after the initial phase of COVID-19, including data from hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients, in order to describe and understand the full spectrum of COVID-19. Finally, these data will inform public health and social policy tailoring. In this study, we demonstrate diverse persistent symptoms 12 weeks after discharge in adult patients with COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS\n",
    "Patients eligible for inclusion were hospitalized at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. Aarhus University Hospital has a catchment area of 300 000 citizens and has ~850 beds. The Department of Infectious Diseases has 22 beds and an outgoing consultant function at the hospital. All patients suspected of COVID-19 are admitted via the emergency department for clinical evaluation and transferred to the Department of Infectious Diseases if in need of oxygen support. The Infectious Diseases Department currently functions solely as a COVID ward where the bed capacity is adapted to the need. In addition, the ward receives the most critically ill COVID-19 patients from nearby hospitals, including patients in need of extra corporal membrane oxygenation via the intensive care unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "On admission to the emergency department, patients with fever and respiratory symptoms were screened with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2. Patients aged 18 years or older with a positive test who had been hospitalized for at least 12 hours and who had been transferred from the emergency department to the Department of Infectious Diseases were eligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we describe patients hospitalized between March 11 and May 15, during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark. On admission, a comprehensive symptom and medical history was obtained and registered in the patient journal, including duration of symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and concomitant medication. After discharge, patients were offered follow-up consultations. The first consultation was by telephone at ≥6 weeks, and the second consultation was by in-person visit or telephone at ≥12 weeks. Data analyses were done corresponding to days 42 and 84—that is, how many reported a specific symptom on days 42 and 84, respectively, after discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here patients were interviewed according to a COVID-19-specific, structured interview guide addressing organ-specific symptoms to assess whether the symptoms present at admission had resolved or new symptoms had emerged (Supplementary Data). The interview guide was designed to identify and systematically record previous and current symptoms (Table 2). Cognitive function was assessed by the validated orientation, memory, and concentration (OMC) test [9]. An OMC score of ≤24 was interpreted as impaired. Patients with dyspnea were asked whether they had dyspnea at rest, when walking, when walking uphill, or during strenuous physical activity. Severe dyspnea was defined as dyspnea at rest or when walking (equaling a Medical Research Council dyspnea score of 3–5) [10]. An individual interdisciplinary assessment was subsequently offered if needed. Data were analyzed using Stata Intercooled, version 11. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify independent risk factors for persistent COVID-19 symptoms. For calculation of odds ratios (ORs) for risk factors of persistent symptoms, logistic regression was used. Covariates included in the multivariate logistic regression model were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), comorbidity, and smoking. P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient Consent Statement\n",
    "Each patient provided written informed consent. All data were registered in a secure REDCap database hosted at the Clinical Trial Unit, Aarhus University [11]. Data collection was approved by the Central Denmark Region (reference 1-45-70-5-20). The registry- and questionnaire-based design did not require ethical approval (Danish Committee Act, Section 14, Subsection 2), which was confirmed by the Regional Ethics Committee (reference 1-10-72-181-20).\n",
    "\n",
    "RESULTS\n",
    "Between March 11 and May 15, 71 patients were admitted to our department. Of these, 7 patients died in the hospital, 3 died 1–6 weeks after discharge from the hospital, and 3 were transferred to another region and were therefore not eligible for the study. Of 58 eligible patients, 4 subsequently declined follow-up, and 5 were lost to follow-up before 12-week evaluation. Thus, 49 patients contributed with full data and were included in the study.\n",

Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, we evaluated the covariates age, BMI, smoking, and comorbidities as potential independent risk factors for the most common persistent symptoms: fatigue, dyspnea, and difficulty concentrating. We calculated the OR for fatigue, dyspnea, and impaired concentration based on each of these potential risk factors: age over vs under 60 years, BMI over vs under 25 kg/m2, smoker and previous smoker vs nonsmoker, and comorbidity vs no comorbidity. Here we found a significantly reduced OR of difficulty concentrating if the patient was a current (or previous) smoker. Besides that, we found no significant OR for persistent symptoms following admission for COVID-19 for any of the other listed known risk factors for severe COVID-19 (Supplementary Table 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "Among 49 patients included in this cohort study, a concerning 86% and 96% reported the presence of 1 or more symptoms at 6- and 12-week follow-up, respectively, after onset of COVID-19-related symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary persistent symptoms at 6- and 12-week follow-up were fatigue, dyspnea, impaired concentration, cough, and impaired smell and taste, consistent with the literature so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms after hospitalization were reported in an early study including 143 patients discharged after COVID-19 from the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, Italy [6]. The patients were assessed in an outpatient clinic at a mean (SD) of 60.3 (13.6) days after the onset of the first COVID-19 symptom. Only 13% were free of any COVID-19-related symptoms, while 32% had 1 or 2 symptoms and 55% had 3 or more. As in our study, the dominating symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, arthralgia, chest pain, and cough.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few studies have addressed persistent symptoms in nonhospitalized patients. In a multicenter study from the United States, 292 nonhospitalized patients were contacted 7–21 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. They found that 92% had symptoms at the time of the test, and 35% of these still had symptoms at a telephone interview (median, 16 days after the time of the test)—primarily driven by fatigue, cough, headache, and shortness of breath [16]. These early findings should merit equal attention and resources allocated to follow and assess both hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients for persistent symptoms following COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing on the different organ systems, we found that 69% and 67% had 1 or more symptoms originating from the cardiopulmonary system at 6- and 12-week follow-up, with dyspnea, cough, and chest pain being the main dominating complaints. In line with these findings, a recent observational cohort study of 100 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 showed that 78 patients had abnormal findings on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 60 patients showed signs of ongoing inflammation at a median of 71 days after diagnosis. Thirty-six percent of the cohort reported dyspnea and unusual fatigue [17]. These findings were substantiated in a study examining the heart by MRI of 26 SARS-CoV-2-positive athletes who did not require hospitalization [18]. Here, 46% had evidence of myocarditis or prior myocardial injury 12–53 days after their positive test result. Similar reports have emerged on pulmonary sequelae in patients recovering from COVID-19 with persistent symptoms and radiologic abnormalities, consistent with reports of pulmonary dysfunction months after the acute phase of COVID-19 [19, 20].\n",
    "\n",
    "We found that 51% and 57% had 1 or more symptoms potentially originating from the central and peripheral nervous system at the 2 follow-up time points. The dominating symptoms here were headache, paresthesia, and chemosensory dysfunction (smell and taste impairment). Some of these post-COVID-19 symptoms resemble those of patients recovering from, for example, encephalitis, and to some degree meningitis. It has been suggested that coronaviruses are able to reach the central nervous system through hematogenous or neural propagation possibly through the olfactory nerve—which, in part, could explain chemosensory dysfunction [21–23]. In line with our observations, minor neurological manifestations have been reported in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, such as headache, confusion, and “brain fog” [23], but more severe neurological manifestations, such as cerebral ischemic stroke, cerebral perfusion abnormalities, and leptomeningeal enhancement, have also been described [24].\n",
    "\n",
    "Persisting symptoms from multiple organs could reflect the wide distribution of the preferred SARS-CoV-2 host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), in different tissues such as the epithelium of the intestine, the kidneys and blood vessels, the endothelial cells in the lungs, and the endothelial cells in the central nervous system [12, 25, 26]. As viral replication accelerates, epithelial–endothelial barrier integrity is compromised, accentuating the inflammatory response, which may explain the lymphocytic endotheliitis observed in a postmortem pathological examination of the heart, kidney, liver, and lungs in patients who died of COVID-19 [27–30]. This inflammatory phase could contribute to the wide range of persistent symptoms in patients recovering from COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent symptoms following other coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), are also well described. A recent meta-analysis described the clinical long-term outcomes of adult SARS and MERS survivors. The meta-analysis included 28 studies and 2820 patients. Pooled analysis revealed that several complications were common up to 6 months after discharge, such as lung function abnormalities (27%) and psychological impairment including post-traumatic stress disorder (38%), depression (33%), and anxiety (30%), as well as reduced exercise capacity and health-related quality of life [31]. Given that SARS and MERS belong to the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV-2, lessons learned from long-term sequalae following MERS and SARS should help guide clinicians in how to monitor the range of physical and mental health impairments in patients suffering from persistent symptoms following COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, we tended to find more patients with paresthesia and difficulties concentrating at 12 weeks compared with 6 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Cognitive impairment and neurological sequalae are also frequently observed in other patient groups recovering from severe infectious diseases. In a study of 516 older severe sepsis survivors (mean age, 76.9 years), severe sepsis was found to be associated with a nearly 3-fold increase in the odds of moderate to severe cognitive impairment after discharge and further emergence of new symptoms after discharge, as compared with 4517 patients who survived a nonsepsis hospitalization [32].\n",
    "\n",
    "In our study, though the number of patients was small, we found a significantly reduced OR of challenged concentration if the patient was a current (or previous) smoker. Smoking has previously been associated with cognitive impairment [33], although this finding remains to be addressed in large-scale studies. Besides this, we found no increased OR of persistent symptoms 12 weeks after the acute phase of COVID-19 when looking at risk factors such as age, sex, BMI, or comorbidity, emphasizing that persistent symptoms can occur in previously healthy young people. However, in a large prospective cohort study from New York including 5279 patients admitted with COVID-19, older age, high BMI, and multimorbidity were associated with not returning to a usual state of health 14–21 days after detection of SARS-CoV-2 [34].\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we did not systematically collect data on quality of life or whether patients had returned to their baseline health after hospitalization for COVID-19. In a recent study, 120 COVID-19 patients were interviewed by phone at a mean of 110.9 days after discharge. Of the active workers (56 patients), 38 patients had gone back to work at the time of the phone interview, and further, among the 39 patients who regularly participated in sports activities before their hospitalization with COVID-19, 28 patients had been able to resume physical activity, but at a lower level for 18 patients [35]. Similarly, in another study, 100 patients discharged after hospitalization for COVID-19 were interviewed by phone 4–8 weeks after discharge (mean, 48 days) using the European Quality of life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) screening tool to assess mobility, personal care, usual activities, pain, and anxiety/depression. Of the 100 included patients, 68 were managed in hospital wards without needing intensive care unit (ICU) care (ward group). Here a clinically significant drop in EQ5D in 68.8% of the ICU group and 45.6% of the ward group was observed, suggesting prolonged recovery in terms of quality of life [36].\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that we became increasingly aware of symptoms present at follow-up that were not systematically registered during primary admission or initially during follow-up, which is why these findings are not systematically reported here. These symptoms include heart palpation, burning sensation in the chest, dizziness, memory loss, muscle weakness, fluctuating skin rash, and hair loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the benefit of using a clinical multidisciplinary follow-up setting to reduce long-term consequences of critical illness could prove important to patients suffering from persistent symptoms after the acute phase of COVID-19. In a randomized clinical trial including 291 patients recovering from sepsis, patients were randomized to either standard care, provided by their primary care physician (PCP), or standard care plus patient training, case management provided by trained nurses, and clinical decision support for PCPs by consulting physicians. Although there was no significant difference in mental health–related quality of life at 6 months (the primary outcome), the intervention group experienced improvements in several secondary outcomes related to physical function and disability and experienced fewer sleep impairments [37].\n",
    "\n",
    "The documented high prevalence of symptoms after COVID-19, in a population with a growing number of affected individuals, may have huge health and socioeconomic consequences. Neither the pathogenesis nor the organs involved are clear. Caring for these patients will require a multidisciplinary approach in specialized centers in which investigation and treatment are continuously adjusted to new knowledge, where guidance of health care workers who are not familiar with the condition could be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we illustrate the presence of persistent symptoms through a systematic interview, some limitations should be acknowledged. First is the small, homogeneous sample size. Second is the single-center setup; our findings will need confirmation on a larger scale. Third is the lack of a control group. Fourth is the lack of objective measurements. Fifth, these data only address hospitalized patients, and potential persistent symptoms following COVID-19 in nonhospitalized individuals might differ. Finally, loss to follow-up may have introduced selection bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSIONS\n",
    "In this study, we observed the tpersistence of COVID-19-related symptoms. More specifically, 86% and 96% reported the presence of 1 or more symptoms at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively, after onset of COVID-19-related symptoms, as compared with prior hospitalization with COVID-19. The dominating symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea, cough, chemosensory dysfunction, and headache. Overall, there is an urgent need for well-designed longitudinal, multinational, and multisite studies. In such studies, a clear definition of inclusion criteria, uniform definitions of outcomes, and ways to measure these are necessary in order to continuously translate evidence of this new disease into the best possible interdisciplinary assessment and treatment for affected patients.\n",

    "A significant number of coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients continue to have symptoms related to COVID-19 after the acute phase of illness. This post-COVID condition is sometimes called ‘post-COVID syndrome’, ‘long COVID’ or ‘post-acute COVID-19’. Persistent psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 survivors such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic symptoms and cognitive impairment may be related to psychological factors and neurobiological injury. COVID-19 related neurological symptoms including anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, headache and seizures may persist for a long time after the acute COVID-19 illness. Many COVID-19 survivors experience persistent physical symptoms such as cough, fatigue, dyspnea and pain after recovering from their initial illness. There is a high probability that symptoms of psychiatric, neurological and physical illnesses, as well as inflammatory damage to the brain in individuals with post-COVID syndrome increase suicidal ideation and behavior in this patient population. COVID-19 survivors without post-COVID syndrome may also be at elevated suicide risk. Studies of suicidality in COVID-19 survivors are urgently needed and will be a new area of suicide research. An appropriate management of psychiatric, neurological and medical conditions may reduce suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors with or without post-COVID syndrome.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "The coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic began in China in 2019 and quickly spread around the world.1,2 The public health, economic, social and emotional impact of the pandemic is enormous.1,2 By the time of writing of this article, more than 72 million people around the world were infected with COVID-19, and more than 1.6 million people died of COVID-19.3 The uncertainty about the path, duration, extent and effect of the pandemic could lead to the global recession which will probably be long lasting, with no country escaping its impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of the illness, many individuals with COVID-19 experience fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.1 Severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospitalization may involve acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac events, shock and multiorgan failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately, observations have emerged that a significant number of COVID-19 patients continue to have symptoms related to COVID-19 after the acute phase of illness.4,5 According to the UK COVID Symptom Study, about 10% of patients who have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus continue to be sick beyond 3 weeks, and a smaller percentage for months.4 This post-COVID condition is not clearly defined. It is sometimes called ‘post-COVID syndrome’, ‘long COVID’ or ‘post-acute COVID-19 syndrome’.5 It has been proposed to define post-acute covid-19 as extending beyond 3 weeks from the onset of first symptoms and chronic covid-19 as extending beyond 12 weeks.5 We need to attend to these growing longer-term medical and psychosocial consequences of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to:\n",
    "Psychiatric issues\n",
    "Persistent psychiatric disorders among COVID-19 survivors may be related to psychological factors and neurobiological injury.6,7 In many cases, it is probably difficult to separate the impact of psychological factors from neurobiological effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the psychiatric sequelae of a coronavirus disease are a significant clinical challenge.2,4,5 A study of psychiatric consequences of SARS-COV-1 performed at 31–50 months after the infection demonstrated an occurrence of 54.5% of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 39% of depression, 32.5% of panic disorder and 15.6% of obsessive–compulsive disorder, a tremendous increase from the preinfection prevalence of any psychiatric diagnoses of 3%.8 A recent UK study showed that at 2–3 months from disease onset COVID-19 patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety and depression in comparison to controls.9 A study in Italy showed that 1 month after hospital treatment a considerable percentage of COVID-19 patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for obsessive–compulsive symptoms and 40% for insomnia.10\n",
    "\n",
    "Some COVID-19 patients need to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).1 Psychiatric conditions, such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, sleep abnormalities and cognitive impairments, are frequent among people who required a hospitalization to an ICU.11 Up to 33 and 43% of patients treated in an ICU, respectively, develop PTSD and depression.12 Neurocognitive deficits have been observed in 73% of ARDS survivors at the time of hospital discharge, and 47% at 2 years later.13\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological effects\n",
    "For many people to learn that they are infected with COVID-19 evokes significant emotional stress.6 The experience of the potentially lethal and untreatable disease is the cause of a severe distress, which may induce a mental illness or aggravate a pre-existing psychiatric disorder.2,6,14 Symptoms of COVID-19, especially serious symptoms, worry about infecting other people, social isolation and concerns about loss of income and the ability to work in the future may result in a severe emotional distress which may persist for a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurobiological damage\n",
    "Viral infection of the brain may have many neurological and psychiatric consequences, contributing to both the acute phase of COVID-19 and its potential sequelae.7,15 The combination of systemic inflammation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure and neuroinflammation may precipitate or worsen psychiatric disorders.7,15 Neuroinflammation is an important etiological factor for many neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive diseases, including depression, psychosis, autism, alcohol and drug abuse, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depressive symptoms appear to be common in patients with post-COVID syndrome.7,9,10,15 Major depression is one of the most frequent neuropsychiatric disorders related to inflammatory damage to the brain.7,15 Considerable evidence has linked depressive symptoms to pro-inflammatory factors and neuroglial failure.7,15\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 reported to date include encephalopathy, stroke, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, headache, Guillen–Barre Syndrome, Miller Fisher Syndrome and skeletal muscle injury/myalgia.16,17 Besides, multiple epileptic conditions have been observed in patients with COVID-19 including new-onset seizures, convulsive seizures, myoclonic seizures, status epilepticus and new-onset refractory status epilepticus. COVID-19 related neurological symptoms may persist for a long time after the acute COVID-19 illness.18\n",

    "A significant number of individuals experience persistent physical symptoms after recovering from their initial illness.19,20 A recent study in Switzerland showed persistence of symptoms in a third of ambulatory patients 30–45 days after diagnosis.19 Fatigue, dyspnea and loss of taste or smell were the main persistent symptoms. A study in the USA showed that most common persistent symptoms included cough, fatigue and dyspnea.20 Other studies also indicate that COVID-19-related symptoms such as weight loss, dyspnea, asthenia, chest pain, palpitations, headache, cutaneous signs, arthralgia, myalgia, digestive disorders and fever may persist among COVID-19 survivors for weeks or months.21\n",

    "A recent study of patients in Italy hospitalized for COVID-19 found that, an average of 60 days after onset of symptoms, 87.4% still had virus-related symptoms, with 55% having three or more symptoms, especially fatigue, dyspnea and joint and chest pain.22 Persistent fatigue, weakness, poor exercise tolerance, pain, neurological sequelae and the negative psychological effects of prolonged ICU stays have been observed among ARDS survivors.14\n",

    "Post-COVID syndrome in medical professionals\n",
    "Health care professionals frequently get infected with COVID-19.23–25 According to a recent report, at least 120 physicians in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific countries died of the coronavirus disease.24 A recent large study in the U.K. found that relative to non-essential workers, health care professionals had a higher risk of severe COVID-19.25 Post-COVID syndrome in health care professionals decreases their ability to provide medical care and aggravates a shortage of physicians and nurses.\n",

    "Depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, sleep abnormalities and cognitive impairments are associated with suicidal behavior.26,27 For example, lifetime risk of suicide among individuals with untreated depression ranges from 2.2% to 15%.26 Individuals suffering from depression are at 25 times greater risk for suicide than the general population.26 Physical illnesses including neurological conditions are also associated with non-lethal suicide attempts and suicide death.27–29 For example, chronic pain conditions have been associated with suicidal behavior.28 One study found that nearly 9% of suicide victims in 18 U.S. States from 2003 to 2014 had documentation of chronic pain in their records and that the percentage of suicide victims with chronic pain grew during the study time frame.28 Also, people with seizure disorders have a higher risk of suicide ideation and suicidal behaviors than the general population.27,29\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a high probability that symptoms of psychiatric, neurological and physical illnesses, as well as inflammatory damage to the brain in individuals with post-COVID syndrome increase suicidal ideation and behavior in this patient population (Figure 1). COVID-19 survivors without post-COVID syndrome may also be at elevated suicide risk. Studies of suicidality in COVID-19 survivors are urgently needed and will be a new area of suicide research. We need to study what factors may increase suicide risk among the COVID-19 survivors during and after the recovery. We also need to investigate whether there is a long-term increased suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors. Currently, health care professionals and public health authorities are focused on taking care of COVID-19 patients and containing the coronavirus’s spread in the general population. Care for mental disorders and psychiatric research may be somewhat deprioritized during the COVID-19 crisis. It has been noted that from January to July 2020 ‘635 000 people died from COVID-19. However, the number of deaths by suicide is not much lower, 462 000. If governments invested in suicide research and prevention only 5% of what they invest in dealing with COVID-19, we could save thousands of lives’.30\n",

    "It is to be hoped that the studies of possible suicidality among individuals with post-COVID syndrome and other COVID-19 survivors will improve our understanding of psychiatric condition and suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors and help to develop suicide prevention interventions for this population. It is important to note that an appropriate management of psychiatric, neurological and medical conditions may reduce suicide risk among COVID-19 survivors with or without post-COVID syndrome.\n",

In addition, some patients who recovered from COVID-19 reported hair loss a few months aer the onset of the disease. Alopecia is a late-onset symptom of COVID-19. e cause of alopecia is unknown; however, androgenic alo-pecia and telogen euvium are possible causes.Keywords:   alopecia; COVID-19; duration; late-onset symptoms; prolonged symptoms.Prolonged symptoms aer coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovery have been a social concern. Although pre-vious studies have investigated post-COVID-19 symptoms 14–21days aer diagnosis [1] and approximately 60days aer symptom onset [2], no studies have shown a longer progres-sion of symptoms than these studies. In addition, few previous studies have investigated COVID-19-related late-onset symp-toms that tend to emerge aer recovery [1]. Androgenetic alo-pecia was present in the majority of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [3], and acute telogen euvium associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was reported [4]; however, alopecia as a late-onset symptom has not been reported to date. In this study, we investigated the dura-tion of persistent symptoms and late-onset symptoms including alopecia in patients who were discharged from the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) aer recovery from COVID-19.METHODSStudy Participants and StudyPeriodPatients who were admitted due to COVID-19 at the Disease Control and Prevention Center (DCC) and the NCGM and who were discharged between February 2020 and June 2020 were in-vited to the telephone interviews. Patients who died during ad-mission or their family were not invited to participate in the interviews. The telephone interviews were conducted from July 30, 2020 to August 13, 2020.Patient Consent StatementWritten informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center Hospital of the NCGM (NCGM-G-003472-03).StudyMethodAs part of outpatient follow-up support, the investigators (M.A., Y.M., M.T., Y.O., S.M., K.T.) conducted one-on-one structured individual telephone interviews with the patients. Each inter-view lasted approximately 5–10 minutes, and each patient was interviewed once. The investigators were nurses, researchers, and physicians working in the DCC and NCGM.Items InvestigatedInformation obtained from participants included age, sex, eth-nicity, smoking history, history of alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), medical conditions, abnormalities on imaging studies, respiratory failure status, mechanical ventilation status, extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation requirements, and medica-tions (antivirals, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants). Accurate information regarding clinical and laboratory parameters was stored in the electronic files of each participant, which were re-trieved for analysis.In the one-on-one structured individual telephone inter-views, participants were asked about symptoms and symptom duration on admission. For alopecia, we asked whether par-ticipants ever felt that their hair fell out more easily aer re-covery. ey were also asked about when they felt their hair was falling out more easily. e investigators double-checked the symptoms with each participant by checking the electronic les. ey were also asked about other symptoms including al-opecia, which they noticed aer discharge, and its duration. If they were not able to recall symptom duration, the answers were regarded as missing values.RESULTSA total of 78 patients were potentially eligible for follow-up tele-phone interviews.

    "BRIEF REPORT  •  OFID • 358.6days (SD=37.2). Among the 14 patients, alopecia re-solved in 5 patients. The mean duration of alopecia among the 5 patients was 76.4 days (SD = 40.5). The remaining 9 patients still had alopecia at the time of the interview. The mean duration of alopecia among the 9 patients was 47.8days (SD=32.2).DISCUSSIONWe investigated the duration of persistent symptoms and late-onset symptoms, including alopecia, in patients with COVID-19. The most important findings throughout this study were dyspnea (n= 7, 11.1%), fatigue (n = 6, 9.5%), cough (n = 4, 6.3%), dysosmia (n=6, 9.7%), and dysgeusia (n=1, 1.6%) that persisted for more than 120days after symptom onset, whereas fever was the most frequent symptom (n = 45, 71.4%) at the onset of the disease. Further research is needed to identify the risk factors contributing to long-term persistence of symp-toms and to clarify whether treatment for COVID-19 may re-duce the incidence or shorten the duration of post-COVID-19 symptoms.e second important nding was that 24.1% of patients with COVID-19 reported alopecia 58.6days (mean SD=37.2) aer symptom onset, and that the mean duration of alopecia was 76.4days. Alopecia is frequently observed in other post-viral infections such as Ebola virus disease and dengue fever [5, 6]. e cause of alopecia aer recovering COVID-19 is un-known; however, androgenic alopecia and telogen euvium are possible causes [3, 4].e ndings of this study are subject to several limitations. First, this study relied on patient self-reports and therefore might have been subject to recall bias. Second, those with more severe symptoms might have been less likely to respond to tel-ephone calls if they were subsequently hospitalized or unable to answer the telephone, making data on the critically ill more likely to be scarce. ird, this was a single-center study with a small sample size. Finally, some patients still had prolonged symptoms at the time of the interview. Continual monitoring of long-lasting symptoms is needed to obtain a more accurate duration of prolonged symptoms.CONCLUSIONSSome patients who recover from COVID-19 have prolonged symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, cough, and dysosmia.

    "\n",
    "Results 113 COVID-19 survivors were included (mild/moderate 47, severe/critical 66). We confirmed several comorbidities as risk factors for severe/critical disease. Severe/critical disease was associated with impaired pulmonary function, i.e. diffusing capacity (DLCO) %-predicted, reduced 6-MWD, and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. After adjustment for potential confounding by age, sex, and BMI, patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had a 20.9 (95% CI 12.4–29.4, p=0.01) lower DLCO %-predicted at follow up. DLCO %-predicted was the strongest independent factor associated with previous severe/critical disease when age, sex, BMI, 6MWD, and minimal SpO2 at exercise, were included in the multivariable model (adjusted odds ratio [OR] per 10%-predicted 0.59 [95% CI 0. 37–0.87], p=0.01).

    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the coronavirus that leads to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the current pandemic is the most critical ongoing global health care problem. To date, more than 1.4 million people succumbed to COVID-19 [1, 2]. In Switzerland, as of November 25th 2020, in total 309 469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 4 030 patients died [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 is a heterogeneous disease with most patients experiencing mild illness and spontaneous recoveries, but a relevant subgroup of individuals requires hospitalisation for pneumonia and other complications. In the initial reports from Wuhan, China, up to one third of patients developed severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [4]. While we have already discovered much about the pathogenesis and treatment of the acute SARS CoV-2 disease, intermediate and long-term outcomes are still unknown, particularly in survivors of severe disease courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous coronavirus infections include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). Similar to COVID-19, SARS and MERS typically begin with an acute illness from which most patients recover after 2 weeks. However, up to one third of SARS patients developed severe pulmonary complications and ARDS [5]. A subgroup of SARS survivors developed persistent lung parenchymal abnormalities, including pulmonary fibrosis [6, 7]. The appearance of pulmonary fibrosis correlated with severity and duration of the acute illness [8, 9], and radiological features of fibrosis persisted in approximately 30% of patients after three and 6 months [10, 11]. Older age, and male sex were identified as risk factors for poor outcomes and development of lung fibrosis [10, 12].\n",
    "\n",
    "With the anticipation of potential long-term sequelae after COVID-19, follow-up strategies have been proposed by several groups from the US, Great Britain, China, and India [13–16].\n",
    "\n",
    "Switzerland has been one of the first European countries affected by COVID-19 with increasing number of confirmed cases from February 25th onwards [3]. A nationwide lockdown was installed on March 16th to prevent further spreading. Six months later, we are facing not only challenges in acute COVID-19 patient care, but also in the follow-up and management of COVID-19 survivors presenting with sequelae of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "We initiated the multicentre Swiss national COVID-19 lung study group to assess pulmonary post sequela of COVID-19. In this first analysis of our prospective cohort we report on chronic pulmonary sequelae of patients who had experienced mild to moderate (mild/moderate) and severe to critical (severe/critical) COVID-19, with the goal to improve the current understanding of the heterogeneous COVID-19 trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS\n",
    "Study setting, patients, and clinical measurements\n",
    "This national, multicentre, prospective observational cohort study includes adults who survived acute COVID-19 and presented for clinical follow-up after either mild to moderate or severe to critical COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributing centres for the Swiss COVID-19 lung study are the University Hospital Bern (Inselspital), Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), University Hospital Geneva (HUG), University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Kantonspital St. Gallen, Kantonspital Freiburg, Hospital of Sion, Hospital of Basel (Claraspital), and Hospital of Tessin (Clinica Luganese Moncucco). All patients provided written informed consent before inclusion. Ethics approval was obtained prior to start of the study on May 1, 2020 (KEK 2020–00799). Baseline information e.g. symptoms at initial presentation was retrieved from medical record. Pulmonary functional tests, measurement of carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and 6-min walk tests (6-MWT) were performed using established protocols [17–20]. Respiratory muscle strength was estimated by measurement of maximum static inspiratory pressure (PImax) and maximum static expiratory pressure (PEmax) at the mouth [21]. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were performed in clinically symptomatic patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients were stratified into the following two groups according to four severity grades described by WHO: 1. Mild disease, or moderate disease with clinical signs of pneumonia and SpO2≥90% (mild/moderate), 2. Severe disease with pneumonia and SpO2<90%, respiratory rate >30 min−1, or critical disease i.e. ARDS, sepsis, septic shock, and multi organ failure (severe/critical) [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Chest CT acquisition\n",
    "Standard chest CT scans were acquired according to the local protocols in participating centres. 52 follow-up chest CT scans from the 113 included patients were available. All chest CT scans were reconstructed with about 1 mm slice thickness. Application of iodine contrast agents was only performed if pulmonary embolism was suspected and/or in case of clinical deterioration. Multiplane reconstructions were performed in axial, coronal and sagittal planes as required. All images were reconstructed with lung- and soft tissue kernels and stored in the local picture archiving and communication system (PACS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Image analysis\n",
    "All available CT scans were collected from Bern and Lausanne and de-identified in the local image archive system (PACS Carestream Health, Rochester, United States for Lausanne; Sectra PACS, IDS7, Linköping, Sweden for Bern). Two subspecialized chest radiologists from two tertiary care centres performed a consensus read-out, blinded to the clinical status of the patients. For the reading process, the radiologists reviewed the cases online via screen sharing (Cisco Webex), as the current pandemic regulations restrict physical meetings. The readers assessed the presence of the following chest CT patterns: consolidation; ground glass opacities (focal, multifocal, diffuse); mosaic attenuation pattern (hypo-, hyperattenuating areas); perilobular consolidation (organising pneumonia-like pattern); reticulations; architectural distortion; honey combing; traction bronchiectasis; pneumatoceles; curvilinear lines; nodules; pleural thickening or pleural effusion; mucus plugging; vascular abnormalities and additional findings were annotated separately. Pattern distribution was also recorded (upper lobe, middle lobe/ lingula and lower lobe). A semi-quantitative estimation of the disease extent was performed, based on the system proposed by Francone et al. [22]. The CT-score is derived from extent of lobar involvement based on a 5 point scale (0:0%; 1,<5%; 2:5–25%; 3:26–50%; 4:51–75%; 5,>75%; range 0–5; global score 0–25).\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are reported as mean (standard deviation [sd]) or median (interquartile range [IQR]). Differences between mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 groups were analysed for statistical significance by chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and by two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables as applicable. The associations of demographic factors, pulmonary and physical function tests, and radiological signs with the COVID-19 severity groups were estimated using linear or logistic regression models where applicable. Models were adjusted for potential confounders with either conceptual importance (age, sex) or a statistically significant relationship to COVID-19 severity (p<0.1). Model fit was examined using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for AUC were calculated from bootstrap resampling with 2000 repetitions. The final models were selected based on overall AUC. A two-sided p<0.05 was considered for all comparisons. Data were analysed using R version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).\n",

    "\n",
    "Pulmonary function, physical performance, and oxygenation\n",
    "Overall, average pulmonary function was normal in patients after mild/moderate COVID-19. Patients after severe/critical COVID-19 had generally lower lung volumes that were still within the normal range, whereas average measures of diffusion capacity (DLCO), physical performance and oxygenation were reduced. Specifically, total lung capacity (TLC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and DLCO were significantly lower in patients after severe/critical COVID-19 compared to patients after mild/moderate disease. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate disease course had a higher ratio of FEV1/FVC than those with severe/critical illness (table 1). Patients with severe/critical disease had impaired and significantly lower DLCO compared to patients with mild/moderate disease (mean [sd] DLCO 73.2 [18.4] versus 95.3 [20.3] %-predicted, p= 0.003). 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was 120 m lower in the severe/critical disease group, with an average SpO2 decrease of 5.6 (sd 3.8) % in the severe to critical group compared to 2.5 (3.1) % in the mild to moderate disease group (p=0.02). Similarly, 4 months after COVID-19, former severe/critical patients had lower paO2 compared to former mild/moderate patients (paO2 79 [12.2] versus 87.5 [9] mmHg, p=0.0002) (table 1). Respiratory muscle strength did not differ in both groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the subgroup of patients who needed mechanical ventilation (39 patients with severe/critical disease) several measures of pulmonary function at follow-up were negatively correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation during acute COVID-19 (Table S2). Specifically, DLCO and TLC showed a moderately strong negative correlation with duration of ventilation (r=−0.43/p=0.008 and r=−0.42/p=0.01, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical associations with a severe/critical disease course\n",
    "Unadjusted analysis showed patients after severe/critical COVID-19 being 7.4 (95% CI 3–11.7, p=0.002) years older and having a 4.4 (95% CI 2.3–6.4, p<0.001) higher BMI than patients after mild/moderate disease. FVC %-predicted was 9 percent lower (95% CI 1.5 to 16.4) and TLC %-predicted was 15.9 percent lower (95% CI 8.3 to 23.6) lower after severe/critical than after mild/moderate COVID-19. After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, TLC %-predicted remained significantly lower in the severe/critical disease group (14.6 [95% CI 6.3 to 22.8], p<0.001), whereas FVC %-predicted lost statistical significance (5.6 [95% CI −2.6 to 13.8], p=0.18). DLCO %-predicted was significantly higher after mild/moderate COVID-19 on unadjusted analysis (22.1 [95% CI 14.4–29.8], p=0.001), and after adjustment for above confounders (20.9 [95% CI 12.4–29.4], p=0.01).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, survivors of severe/critical COVID-19 had a markedly lower 6MWD on unadjusted (120 [95% CI 80–160] meters, p=0.001) and adjusted analyses (86 [95% CI 45–127] meters, p=0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and BMI, minimal SpO2 on 6MWD was 2.2 (95% CI 0.4–4.0, p=0.01) % and paO2 was 5 (95% CI 0.3–10.2, p=0.06) mmHg lower after severe/critical disease.\n",

Table 2 illustrates the final multivariable model including clinical and functional variables statistically and conceptually associated with a severe/critical course of COVID-19 in our cohort. High DLCO %-predicted at follow-up was the factor with the strongest independent association with a more favourable previous course of disease (p=0.01).

    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "To our knowledge, this is the first European study reporting on respiratory follow-up outcomes after SARS CoV-2 infection. After an average observation time of 4 months, our cohort reveals impairments in pulmonary function and physical performance that were more pronounced in patients with previously severe and critical COVID-19 courses, compared to those with mild and moderate illness. Specifically, DLCO %-predicted at 4 months was the most important, independent correlate of a more severe initial disease. Furthermore, in the subcohort of patients with available chest CT scan, we identified a mosaic attenuation pattern with hypoattenuated areas of various size limited by geographic margins with bulging of secondary pulmonary lobules, as well as reticulations as distinct radiological features after severe/critical COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information on risk factors for the development of COVID-19 pneumonia and a severe disease course is increasing, and our study supports many of the findings from previous reports [23–25]. In our cohort, we can confirm that age and age-associated comorbidities significantly contribute to the inter-individual heterogeneity in the severity of acute COVID-19 [24]. For example, with obesity emerging as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality [27–29], findings from the Swiss COVID-19 lung cohort confirm the importance of this modifiable risk factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 primarily affects the lung and airways and may lead to respiratory failure [25]. Five-year survivors of ARDS were found to be functionally impaired with a median 6MWD of 76% predicted [30]. Similarly, a meta-analysis on long-term outcomes after SARS and MERS, identified a reduced 6MWD and DLCO compared to healthy individuals [31]. A 3-month follow-up study of a Wuhan cohort (mostly mild pneumonia) demonstrated reduced pulmonary function in 14 out of 55 cases, including 9 out of 55 cases with reduced DLCO [32]. In our study, reduced DLCO, decreased distance of 6MWT and desaturation during 6MWT were associated with the a severely impaired COVID-19 phenotype, and importantly this relationship was not confounded by age, sex, or BMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prevalence and extent of pulmonary function and physical impairment after different clinical courses of COVID-19 are still uncertain. In our cohort we demonstrate lower lung volumes (TLC, FVC, and FEV1) in patients after severe/critical COVID-19, the higher FEV1/FVC ratio in the severe/critical subgroup suggests a tendency toward a restrictive physiology, and the lack of difference in respiratory muscle strength suggest a lung parenchymal rather than a respiratory muscle issue. Furthermore, we demonstrate a negative correlation between the duration of mechanical ventilation during the acute disease and pulmonary function at 4-month follow-up. This might be due to a prolonged impairment after very severe COVID-19 or related to more severe disease course in susceptible patients. Alternatively, ventilator induced lung-injury is a well-described challenge post-ARDS, which can impact on pulmonary function after recovery from the acute illness [30].\n",
    "\n",
    "On chest CT scans, acute COVID-19 typically presents with progressive ground glass opacities, alveolar consolidations, with a common subpleural and basal location, rounded lesions, crazy paving pattern, linear densities, parenchymal bands and architectural distortion perhaps representing organising pneumonia and/or fibrotic changes [33]. This presents as an overall radiological picture that is distinct from other viral infections, such as influenza [34, 35]. Similar to the clinical evolution, the trajectory of radiological patterns is reported as heterogeneous. After a mean observation time of 10 days, lung parenchymal abnormalities seem to have improved in most cases, while some patients persistently show mild signs of pulmonary fibrosis [36]. At short-term follow up, the most frequent radiological abnormalities included ground glass opacities, consolidation, and parenchymal bands [37]. Reports on medium or long-term development of radiological abnormalities are currently very limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Four months after the initial diagnosis the predominant finding in our severe/critical subcohort was a mosaic attenuation pattern, characterised by abnormally hypodense areas corresponding to one or several contiguous secondary pulmonary lobules alternating with normal or abnormally hyperdense areas (i.e. ground glass attenuation), as well as more frequent reticulations. In most cases, there was a sharp demarcation and delineation of the margins of the involved secondary pulmonary lobules, with sometimes hyperdense bands silhouetting the abnormal lobules. The combination of mosaic attenuation pattern and impaired DLCO can either be attributed to abnormalities in the distal airways such as constrictive bronchiolitis with air trapping and secondary reflex vasoconstriction or a primary pulmonary vascular disease that may induce secondary airway disease. Both mechanisms can cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch contributing to the reduced physical performance and hypoxemia that we observed in our severe/critical subcohort. Endothelial injury and alveolar capillary microthrombosis have been discussed as underlying mechanisms of pulmonary vascular disease [38]. Airway disease and air trapping were also described after adult ARDS in the setting of influenza, MERS and SARS [7, 39, 40]. Overall, observations from previous studies combined with the high prevalence of the mosaic attenuation pattern specifically in our severe/critical COVID-19 subcohort, suggest that this pattern is an important late feature of severe COVID-19. Signs of fibrosis that we observed in our cohort (reticulations, bronchiectasis and honeycombing) are frequently encountered in survivors of ARDS. While initial observations reported fibrosis after COVID-19 associated ARDS [40], mosaic attenuation and air trapping has not been described after COVID-19 before. We recently reported that radiological mosaic attenuation and air trapping might indicate small airway disease [41]. This finding has previously been reported after coronavirus infection and virus-associated ARDS [7, 39, 40]. The radiological and functional abnormalities observed in our study might represent residual damage after ARDS in general, after ventilator-induced lung injury, or specifically after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Potential development of progressive interstitial lung disease after COVID-19 might be attributed to stimulation of autoimmune pathways triggered by SARS-CoV-2 or progression from pre-existing interstitial lung abnormalities to clinically significant ILD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolonged functional impairment with slow recovery over several years after ARDS is not uncommon [30], however potential long-term consequences specifically after COVID-19 still need to be investigated in future observational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of our study does not allow any inference on prevalence of severe/impaired and mild/moderate COVID-19 as patients who deceased were not included, and we did not include asymptomatic patients for follow-up. Initial pulmonary function tests and imaging were not available, consequently patients who experienced severe/critical disease might have had a predisposing undiagnosed lung disease and consequently poorer pulmonary function at follow-up. Patients were questioned thoroughly for symptoms and a medical history that might have indicated previous lung disease. However, asymptomatic underlying chronic lung disease cannot be completely excluded. In addition, initial interstitial lung abnormalities or involvement of the airways in COVID-19 infection cannot be assessed due to the lack of previous chest CT scan in most cases. However, our findings combined with previous studies support the hypothesis that severe COVID-19 causes a medium-term decrease in DLCO, limitations in gas exchange and a spectrum of radiological features not previously reported pointing towards a considerable small airway component.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, with the analysis of pulmonary function, physical performance, oxygenation and radiological findings 4 months after COVID-19 our study adds to the growing body of evidence on post COVID-19 trajectories. We identified DLCO %-predicted at 4 months as the single most important factor associated with severe/critical respiratory COVID-19 which translates to reduced walking distance and oxygen desaturation on exercise. The peculiar radiological presentation should be further investigated to provide an overall assessment of the disease in conjunction with other functional parameters. These results emphasise the importance of a systematic follow up after severe and critical COVID-19, with appropriate management of pulmonary sequelae.\"\"\"\n",

    "Design, Setting, and Participants  This prospective cohort study at an academic hospital in Northern Italy was conducted among a consecutive series of patients aged 18 years and older (or their caregivers) who had received a confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection severe enough to require hospital admission from March 1 to June 29, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed via reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction testing, bronchial swab, serological testing, or suggestive computed tomography results.\n",

    "Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome of the study was to describe the proportion of patients with a diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (Dlco) less than 80% of expected value. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients with severe lung function impairment (defined as Dlco <60% expected value); proportion of patients with posttraumatic stress symptoms (measured using the Impact of Event Scale–Revised total score); proportion of patients with functional impairment (assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score and 2-minute walking test); and identification of factors associated with Dlco reduction and psychological or functional sequelae.\n",

Dlco was reduced to less than 80% of the estimated value in 113 patients (51.6%) and less than 60% in 34 patients (15.5%). The SPPB score was suggested limited mobility (score <11) in 53 patients (22.3%). Patients with SPPB scores within reference range underwent a 2-minute walk test, which was outside reference ranges of expected performance for age and sex in 75 patients (40.5%); thus, a total of 128 patients (53.8%) had functional impairment.

    "Introduction\n",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can be completely asymptomatic or, conversely, can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which the clinical outcomes range from mild upper airways symptoms to a severe disease with respiratory failure and a high fatality rate.1 As of November 2020, more than 60 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, and more than 1.4 million people have died.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers focused attention on clinical features and prognosis of the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.3,4 As a consequence, we are now far more able to estimate prognoses and optimize clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19 compared with the beginning of the pandemic.5\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the type and severity of respiratory or functional sequelae COVID-19 are unknown. While COVID-19 is a systemic disease,6 the lungs are most commonly affected, with histopathological findings that may include diffuse alveolar epithelium destruction, capillary damage or bleeding, hyaline membrane formation, alveolar septal fibrous proliferation, and pulmonary consolidation.7 As a consequence, the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is commonly altered in patients who recover from COVID-19,8 similarly to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), illnesses that are associated with an impairment of lung function lasting months to years.9,10 Impairment in exercise capacity often parallels Dlco reduction: patients who recover from SARS pneumonia have been found to have 6-minute walking test and 36-item Short Form General Health Survey scores persistently lower than the general population.9 Moreover, the functional impairment associated with COVID-19 may also be associated with adverse psychological outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach investigating the functional and psychological aspects associated with COVID-19 may be more effective in disclosing potential sequelae associated with COVID-19. In this prospective cohort study, we aimed to investigate prevalence and clinical associations of functional and psychological impairment 4 months after recovery from COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "This cohort study was approved by the Comitato Etico Interaziendale Novara ethical committee. All participants provided written informed consent. This study was conducted in strict accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki11 and reported following the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Population\n",
    "We contacted 767 consecutive patients (or their caregivers) aged 18 years or older who were discharged between March 1 and June 29, 2020, from the Azienda Ospedaliero–Universitaria Maggiore della Carità university hospital in Novara, Italy, where they had been admitted for COVID-19. Patients were contacted by telephone, and telephone follow-up was performed 3 to 4 months after discharge. A total of 35 patients (4.6%) died after discharge. Of the remaining patients, 494 (64.4%) declined participation (Figure). Among 238 patients who agreed to participate, 232 participants (97.5%) had diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed during their hospital stay by reverse-transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal swab; in 1 participants whose RT-PCR test was negative for SARS-CoV-2, the diagnosis was confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage. The remaining 5 participants were diagnosed according to a combination of serological tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and suggestive computed tomography.\n",
    "\n",
    "An electronic case report form was generated using the Research Electronic Data Capture software (Vanderbilt University) to collect clinical data following pseudonymization. Data entry was performed by clinicians involved in the treatment of patients with COVID-19; inpatient clinical data were retrospectively collected from clinical charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We collected data on patients’ demographic characteristics and regular medication use, symptoms at COVID-19 diagnosis and complications during the hospital stay (retrospectively documented), and type and number of comorbidities, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease, autoimmune disease, hematological diseases, coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation and other structural or arrythmogenic heart disease, endocrine diseases, chronic kidney disease (CKD), previous stroke or venous thromboembolism, anxiety and depression, or active malignant neoplasm. We additionally collected data on patients’ symptoms at follow-up, including fever, cough, dyspnea, ageusia, anosmia, diarrhea, arthralgia, myalgia, chest pain, sore throat, headache, and perception of reduced tolerance to physical activity compared with before they contracted COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pulmonary Function Tests\n",
    "All patients underwent standard pulmonary function testing (PFT) with a Quark PFT with X9 pneumotach (COSMED) for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), vital capacity, forced vital capacity (FVC), Dlco, Dlco constant, and total lung capacity. Dlco and total lung capacity were determined by the single-breath co technique. The hemoglobin value was evaluated before PFT to apply the appropriate correction to Dlco.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spirometer underwent calibration the day the test was performed, and barometric pressure and temperature were simultaneously recorded. A trained technician coached the patient, while a pulmonologist (E. C., E. P., or F. P.) was responsible for test validation and interpretation based on the 2005 the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society statements.12,13 Briefly, the following safety measures were adopted: in a dedicated room, a dedicated spirometer was used to avoid cross-infection of patients not included in this program. The technician (and the pulmonologist, if needed) used full PPE (ie, face mask, N95 respirator, gown, and gloves). To avoid cross-infections between patients included in the program, a mouthpiece with an antimicrobial filter was used and changed for every patient. At the end of each day, the room underwent disinfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical Performance Tests\n",
    "We assessed the patients’ physical performance with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), which includes balance assessment in standing position, walking speed for 4 m, and standing up from a chair with 5 repetitions. This test allows hierarchizing patients according to their functional status with a good predictivity on the disability level in daily activities. A score greater than 10 is the expected value for healthy individuals.14,15\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that SPPB may not distinguish performance level in high-functioning patients.16 To improve the sensitivity of functional impairment detection, patients with SPPB scores greater than 10 were tested with the 2-minute walk test to evaluate the residual aerobic capacity; the 2-minute walk test score was compared with reference data for an age- and sex-matched population.17-19\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological Symptoms Tests\n",
    "We assessed the presence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms by administering the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R),20 a 15-item self-rated 4-point scale based on how often an event has occurred in the past 7 days (0 indicates not at all; 1, rarely; 3, sometimes; 5, often). All IES-R items are anchored to a specific stressor. Besides the IES total subjective stress score, 2 subscales were identified. One subscale measured intrusive symptoms, including intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and intrusive feelings and imagery, using 7 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 35; the other subscale measured avoidance symptoms, such as numbing of responsiveness and avoidance of feelings, situations, or ideas, using 8 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 40.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis\n",
    "Data were analyzed using the Stata statistical software version 15.1 (StataCorp). Normality was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test. The measures of centrality and dispersion chosen for continuous variables were medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs); comparisons between groups for these variables were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Categorical variables, whenever dichotomous or nominal, were reported as frequencies and percentages and analyzed through the Pearson χ2, Cochran-Armitage test, or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a Dlco less than 80% of expected. The study was sufficiently powered to detect as statistically significant a 0.12 increase in the proportion of patients with Dlco less than 80% of expected among survivors of COVID-19 compared with that observed in a reference population21 (0.30 vs 0.18, respectively), with an α = .005. Secondary end points were prevalence of a more severe respiratory impairment (defined as Dlco <60% of expected), potentially associated with a higher risk of pulmonary fibrosis; factors associated with a Dlco less than 80% or less than 60% of expected; prevalence and factors associated with functional impairment (defined as SBBP score <11 or SBBP score ≥11 in presence of a 2-minute walk test score outside of age- and sex-matched reference range); and prevalence and factors associated with moderate to severe PTS symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the associations with the different end points used, we conducted a univariate analysis, including the comorbidities with a biological plausible correlation with disease sequelae, age, sex, smoking status, intensive care unit (ICU) admission during hospital stay, number of comorbidities, and modality of oxygen delivery during hospital stay. P values were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at P = .05. All associations with P < .20 were then included in logistic regression models.\n",

    "Among 238 patients included in analysis, the median (IQR) age was 61 (50-71) years, and 142 (59.7%) were men. The main characteristics of participants are listed in Table 1. During hospital stays, 66 patients (27.7%) did not require supplementary oxygen, 102 patients (42.9%) received oxygen via nasal cannulae or Venturi masks, 49 patients (20.6%) required noninvasive ventilation, and 21 patients (8.8%) underwent mechanical ventilation. A total of 28 patients (11.8%) were admitted to an ICU, with a median (IQR) stay of 8.5 (5.5-20.5) days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most commonly reported symptoms during the acute phase but largely remitted in the following months. However, 13 patients (5.5%) still reported dyspnea at 4 months after discharge (Table 1). At 4 months, 12 patients (5.0%) still experienced ageusia and 11 patients (4.6%) still experienced anosmia. Additionally, 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing arthralgia at follow-up, and 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing myalgia.\n",
    "\n",
    "PFTs\n",
    "A total of 14 patients were not able to complete PFTs. Among the remaining 224 patients, the median (IQR) FEV1 was 101% (91.5%-112%) of expected and the median (IQR) FVC was 98.5% (90%-109%) of expected. Five more patients were not able to complete the assessment of the Dlco, which was therefore measured in 219 patients. The median (IQR) Dlco was 79% (69%-89%) of expected. Dlco was less than 80% of expected in 113 patients (51.6%); more severe impairment (ie, Dlco <60% of expected) was observed in 34 patients (15.5%). The results of the univariate analysis of factors associated with impaired Dlco are reported in eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement. In logistic regression analysis, risk factors associated with Dlco less than 80% of expected at follow-up included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 4.33 [95% CI, 2.25-8.33]; P < .001), CKD (OR, 10.12 [95% CI, 2.00-51.05]; P = .005), and the modality of oxygen delivery during hospital stay (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.08-2.61]; P = .02). Risk factors associated with Dlco less than 60% at follow-up were female sex (OR, 2.70 [95% CI, 1.11-6.55]; P = .03), COPD (OR, 5.52 [95% CI, 1.32-23.08]; P = .02), and ICU admission during hospital stay (OR, 5.76 [95% CI, 1.37-24.25]; P = .02) (Table 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical Performance Evaluation\n",
    "With regard to physical function, 53 patients (22.3%) were found to have limited mobility based on SPPB test results. All other patients underwent a 2-minute walk test, which revealed a subtler impairment in 75 patients (31.5%). By this method, we identified 128 patients (53.8%) with some degree of functional impairment. The results of univariate analysis are reported in eTable 3 in the Supplement, and logistic regression analysis results are reported in Table 3. COPD was associated with an increased risk of physical impairment (OR, 12.70 [95% CI, 1.41-114.85]; P = .02), and higher Dlco was associated with decreased risk of physical impairment (OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.94-0.98]; P < .001).\n",
    "\n",
    "When directly questioned, 50 patients (21.0%) reported that their tolerance to exercise had worsened after COVID-19. Univariate analysis (eTable 4 in the Supplement) and logistic regression (Table 3) found that the perception of reduced tolerance to physical exercise was associated with younger age and ICU admission during hospitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychological Symptoms Tests\n",
    "Finally, we tested patients for PTS symptoms. Results of the IES-R questionnaire were within reference ranges in 136 patients (57.1%), while in 61 patients (25.6%) had mild symptoms, 27 patients (11.3%) had moderate symptoms, and 14 patients (5.9%) had severe symptoms. Male sex was the only factor independently associated with the presence of moderate to severe PTS symptoms (eTable 5 in the Supplement; Table 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "Little is known about the lasting effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors of COVID-19. In this cohort study, we found that a significant proportion of survivors of COVID-19 experienced respiratory or functional impairment 4 months after hospital discharge, with clinically relevant psychological consequences. Indeed, at the end of follow-up, more than half of the study population still had Dlco less than 80% of expected. When a more stringent threshold of less than 60% of expected was applied, the proportion of patients with severe impairment decreased to 15%. Thus, a significantly impaired diffusion persisted in a sizable proportion of survivors of COVID-19. The lack of a pre–COVID-19 measurement prevents exact quantification of the association of COVID-19 with PFT deterioration. However, the isolated reduction of Dlco with a preservation of other PFT parameters is consistent with damage associated with COVID-19, given that Dlco reduction is the most common functional alteration reported in patients with COVID-19.8 In line with our results, a study by Huang et al22 reported that more than 50% of patients had Dlco less than 80% of expected 30 days after hospital discharge. However, a study by Zhao et al23 reported only 9 of 55 patients (16.4%) had a Dlco less than 80% of expected 3 months after hospital discharge. The populations these studies described were significantly different from ours, being younger (median age, 48 years) and with a very low prevalence of smokers; accordingly, these studies included no patients with underlying pulmonary disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for factors associated with reduced Dlco, female sex was a significant factor, possibly reflecting fitness level.24 Interestingly, a history of CKD and the modality of oxygen administration during hospitalization were associated with reductions in Dlco, probably owing to a more severe acute illness.25,26 Conversely, COPD and ICU admission emerged as factors associated with severe lung function impairment. A reduction of Dlco is associated with pulmonary fibrosis in different clinical settings, such as interstitial lung diseases and systemic sclerosis27,28; whether survivors of COVID-19 with impaired Dlco are at increased risk of progressive lung fibrosis will require a longer follow-up. Indeed, fibrotic evolution has been described after SARS pneumonia.29\n",
    "\n",
    "Some degree of motor impairment was observed in 53.8% of our study population. Different factors might be invoked to explain this observation, including lung damage, circulatory limitation, muscle weakness, critical illness neuropathy, and myopathy. Our data suggest an association of pulmonary function impairment; indeed, Dlco and a history of COPD were independently associated with impaired physical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, many people perceived that COVID-19 had a detrimental impact on their physical performances, and ICU admission being associated with this perception may be associated with deconditioning. Remarkably, age was not associated with reduced Dlco or impaired motor function. In COVID-19, the case fatality rate increases with age30; therefore, it would be reasonable to expect a higher burden of residual impairment in older patients. Our data are in contrast with this hypothesis. We speculate that older people may have a higher baseline comorbidity burden, which was detrimentally associated with their survival probability during acute illness, but in survivors, the residual damage was not worse than in younger people. Essentially, this finding confirms that older individuals who survive COVID-19 may not be less able than their younger counterparts to revert to their previous state of health, with no accrual of morbidity. This observation has important implications, given that advancing age is often among the major limitations to admit patients with COVID-19 to an ICU.31\n",
    "\n",
    "With regard to psychological health, clinically relevant PTS symptoms were observed in 17% of patients, in line with other studies, such as that by Chang and Park32 that reported that approximately 20% of survivors of COVID-19 developed posttraumatic stress disorder. In our data, male sex was the only independent factor associated with PTS symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, our data suggest a residual mortality in the first months after discharge from a hospital dedicated to acute care for patients with COVID-19; indeed, around 5% of patients who were discharged after COVID-19 treatment died within a few weeks after discharge. Although we have no information on the causes of death for these patients, this proportion is not negligible and represents, to our knowledge, a worrying novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we investigated the presence of residual symptoms of disease: dyspnea persisted in approximately 10% of patients who reported experiencing it during the acute phase of COVID-19. Carfi et al33 have reported a residual dyspnea in approximately 40% of survivors of COVID-19. However, our study spans a longer follow-up period (4 months vs 2 months). On the other hand, the proportion of patients experiencing chemosensory dysfunction was relatively high. According to a metanalysis by Hajikhani et al,34 at presentation, the estimated rate of taste disorders was 49.0% and of olfactory disorders was 61.0%. Data regarding the short-term recovery from these symptoms are divergent. While a study by Iannuzzi et al35 reported a complete recovery within 1 month, a study by Locatello et al36 reported the persistence of partial or complete chemosensory loss in approximately 30% to 40% of patients. In our study, alterations of taste and smell were still present at 4 months in approximately 17% of patients who had alterations in the acute phase of COVID-19. How long this loss will persist is unknown. Interestingly, one-third of patients reporting arthralgia and myalgia during the acute phase still experienced these symptoms at 4 months. Our findings are in line with 2 cohort studies.33,37 However, the proportion of patients who were symptomatic in our study was lower than those reported in the studies by Carfi et al33 and Carvalho-Schneidfer et al,37 suggesting a progressive improvement over time. Overall, these findings suggest that many patients experience a slow recovery after the acute phase of COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "This study has several limitations. A key limitation of our study is patient selection: we contacted only patients who had a severe enough COVID-19 to be admitted to a hospital. Moreover, many discharged patients declined study participation for reasons that may have included perceived full recovery in some or the inability or unwillingness to attend extra visits. This might have generated a selection bias, considering that the real proportion of patients still experiencing functional or psychological sequelae might have been lower if all had participated. Our psychological evaluation was limited to PTS symptoms, which does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions about the full psychological impact of COVID-19, which may include many other aspects, such as sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, we reported an unexpectedly high residual mortality in the first few months after hospital discharge. This is a novel, worrisome finding that warrants further examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "In this cohort study, a significant proportion of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 still reported a high proportion of symptoms associated with COVID-19 up to 4 months after hospital discharge, with reduced exercise tolerance being the most common. Other midterm sequelae of COVID-19, such as respiratory and physical functional impairment, may impact psychological health. Residual lung injury may be associated with reduced quality of life in survivors of COVID-19. Although age is a major factor associated with COVID-19–related mortality, 4 months after hospital discharge, there was not a higher residual symptomatic burden in the older patients in this study.\"\"\"\n",

    "Background\n",
    "We sought to investigate the risk of psychological diseases among coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) survivors in South Korea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) COVID‐19 cohort database, comprising COVID‐19 patients and a control population from January 1, 2020 to June 4, 2020, was used in this study. COVID‐19 patients were defined as individuals who were confirmed as COVID‐19 positive, regardless of disease severity, and COVID‐19 survivors were defined as individuals who recovered from COVID‐19. The control population was extracted using stratification methods according to the age, sex, and residence of COVID‐19 patients. Individuals previously diagnosed with any psychological disease were excluded from the analysis. The primary endpoint was a new diagnosis of psychological disease. Multivariable logistic modeling was used for statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "A total of 99,742 individuals (5879 [5.9%] COVID‐19 survivors and 93,863 [94.1%] controls) were included in the final analysis. The incidence of newly diagnosed psychological disease, depression, psychosis, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse was 1438 (1.4%), 1268 (1.3%), 44 (0.0%), 173 (0.2%), and 2 (0.0%), respectively. In the multivariable model after adjusting for confounders, the COVID‐19 survivors had a 2.98‐fold higher probability of developing the psychological disease compared with the control group. Specifically, the odds of depression and psychosis in the COVID‐19 survivors were 3.34‐fold and 2.49‐fold higher than that in the control group, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "COVID‐19 survivors had a higher risk of experiencing psychological disease than the control population in South Korea. Particularly, COVID‐19 may increase the risk of developing depression and psychosis.\n",

    "1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Since the initial report of 27 cases of coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) with pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei, China (Lu et al., 2020), on December 31, 2019, this disease has developed into a pandemic. The World Health Organization declared the Chinese outbreak of COVID‐19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020 (Epidemiology Working Group for NCIP Epidemic Response, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020), and it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (Bedford et al., 2020). In August 2020, approximately 5 million cases of COVID‐19 and 150,000 COVID‐19‐related deaths were reported in the United States (Moore & Report, 2020). Currently, there is no available vaccine clinically proven to prevent COVID‐19, rendering COVID‐19 a global and public health crisis (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020; Tu et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are many COVID‐19 survivors, disease sequelae might be considered an important problem upon resumption of daily life or work activities. Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) is known to affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause host immunologic response in the CNS (Paniz‐Mondolfi et al., 2020), some patients with COVID‐19 exhibit acute neuropsychiatric symptoms such as delirium (O'Hanlon & Inouye, 2020), encephalopathy (Chen et al., 2020), and anosmia (Vaira et al., 2020). Recent studies reported that as a subacute to chronic neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID‐19 infection, the frequency and severity of psychiatric symptoms became worse in COVID‐19 patients (Kang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020). Furthermore, there have been some reports showing that COVID‐19 affects the development of psychological diseases, such as depression, psychosis, anxiety, and insomnia (Brown et al., 2020; Huang & Zhao, 2020). However, no study has documented the incidence and risk of psychological diseases among COVID‐19 survivors in comparison to the general population without COVID‐19 infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In South Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) developed the NHIS COVID‐19 database, which consists of COVID‐19 patients and a control population. Using this database, we investigated the risk of psychological diseases among COVID‐19 survivors in South Korea. We hypothesized that COVID‐19 survivors were diagnosed with psychological diseases more frequently than the general population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n",
    "2.1 Study design and ethical statement\n",
    "This population‐based cohort study was conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines (Von Elm et al., 2007). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (X‐2009/636‐902) and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (NHIS‐2020‐1‐291). The requirement for informed consent was waived as data analyses were performed retrospectively using anonymized data derived from the South Korean NHIS database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 The NHIS COVID‐19 cohort database\n",
    "The NHIS COVID‐19 cohort database was developed for medical research in cooperation between the NHIS and KCDC. The KCDC provides information on the patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 from January 1, 2020 to June 4, 2020, including the confirmation date of COVID‐19 diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and demographic information. The COVID‐19 patients in the NHIS COVID‐19 database included all patients who were confirmed as positive in the COVID‐19 test; therefore, COVID‐19 patients who were admitted to the hospital with severe symptoms as well as COVID‐19 patients with no or mild symptoms were included in the database. The COVID‐19 patients who are currently undergoing hospital treatment were not included in this database because their treatment outcomes have not yet been determined. The NHIS extracted a control population from the individual database using stratification methods according to the age, sex, and residence of COVID‐19 patients. Thus, the control population consisted of subjects who had never been diagnosed with COVID‐19 from January 1, 2020 to June 4, 2020. In the NHIS COVID‐19 cohort database, all diagnoses based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)‐10 codes and prescription information on drugs and/or procedures from 2015 to 2020 were included. In this study, data were extracted by a medical record technician unaffiliated to the study at the NHIS center on June 26, 2020. Since foreign COVID‐19 patients were not included in the NHIS COVID‐19 database, the ethnicity in the NHIS COVID‐19 database was relatively homogeneous.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 National health insurance system in South Korea\n",
    "In South Korea, all disease diagnoses and information on drug prescriptions or procedures should be registered in the NHIS database. Additionally, the annual income level of the population should be registered in the NHIS databases to determine insurance fees according to income level. However, most of the population receives similar benefits from the NHIS for their hospital treatment, regardless of insurance fee differences. The NHIS covers a copayment of approximately two‐thirds of the total hospital charges. Furthermore, if patients are unable to pay their insurance premium or have difficulty supporting themselves financially, the government covers almost all medical expenses to reduce the financial burden on these patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 Study population\n",
    "Based on the information provided by the NHIS COVID‐19 cohort database, individuals ≥20 years old were included in the study. To investigate the development of new psychological symptoms in the year 2020, individuals diagnosed with any psychological disease from 2015 to 2019 (5 years) in the NHIS database were excluded from the analysis. In addition, individuals who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 and died from the disease were also excluded from the analysis. Thus, the patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 and discharged from the hospital after treatment were defined as COVID‐19 survivors. In addition, the patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19, but were not admitted to the hospital due to mild or no symptoms, were also defined as COVID‐19 survivors if they were shown to have recovered from COVID‐19 according to the test. In South Korea, the patients who were diagnosed with COVID‐19 were admitted to the hospital if they had severe symptoms such as pneumonia. However, if they had mild or no symptoms, they were isolated and closely monitored in certain government‐managed centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.5 Development of psychological disease as an endpoint\n",
    "Depression (F20.4, F31.3–F31.5, F32*, F33*, F34.1, F41.2, and F43.2), psychosis (F20*, F22*–F25*, F28*, F29*, F30.2, F31.2, and F31.5), alcohol abuse (F10, E52, G62.1, I42.6, K29.2, K70.0, K70.3, K70.9, T51*, Z50.2, Z71.4, and Z72.1), and drug abuse (F11.x–F16.x, F18.x, F19.x, Z71.5, and Z72.2) were considered as psychological diseases in this study. The evaluation period was from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. In South Korea, appropriate financial coverage for psychological diseases is provided only when the psychological disease is registered in the NHIS database by a psychiatrist.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.6 Other confounding factors\n",
    "The following data were obtained as confounders: (1) demographic information (age and sex), (2) place of residence (Seoul, Gyeonggi‐do, Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk‐do, and other areas), (3) underlying disability, (4) income level in 2020, and (5) the Charlson comorbidity index score, which was calculated based on registered ICD‐10 diagnostic codes (Table S1) from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. The income level was divided into four groups using quartile ratio, and the age was categorized into seven groups (20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and ≥80 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.7 Statistical analysis\n",
    "The baseline characteristics are presented as means with standard deviations for continuous variables and numbers with percentages for categorical variables. First, the incidences of psychological disease between the COVID‐19 survivors and the control group were compared using the Χ2 test. Next, as the main analysis, we constructed the multivariable logistic regression model for the development of psychological diseases to investigate its association with COVID‐19. All covariates were included in the multivariable model for adjustment, and the Charlson comorbidity index score was excluded from the model to avoid multicollinearity of the underlying comorbidities, which were used to calculate the Charlson comorbidity index score. Then, we performed competing risk analyses for each psychological disease: depression, psychosis, and alcohol abuse were set as endpoints in each competing risk analysis, but drug abuse was excluded due to the very low number of cases. Finally, we performed subgroup analyses according to sex because mental disorders are known to be influenced by sexual differences (Scott & Collings, 2010). The competing risk analyses and subgroup analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression modeling with all covariates, similar to the main analysis. The Hosmer–Lemeshow statistical test was used to confirm the goodness of fit of the multivariable models with a value of p > .05, and it was confirmed that there was no multicollinearity in all multivariable models of the entire cohort with a variance inflation factor of <2.0. The results of the logistic regression models are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). R software (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing) was used for all analyses, and a value of p < .05 was considered statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 RESULTS\n",
    "The NHIS COVID‐19 cohort comprised 8070 COVID‐19 patients and 121,050 controls. Among the total 129,120 individuals, 4790 were below 20 years old and 24,487 individuals had a history of psychological diseases; 101 individuals who died due to COVID‐19 infection were excluded from the analysis. Thus, a total of 99,742 individuals were included in the final analysis. Among them, 5879 individuals (5.9%) were COVID‐19 survivors, and 93,863 individuals (94.1%) were in the control group. A flowchart depicting patient/control selection is presented in Figure 1. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the individuals included in this study. Among the total cohort, the incidence of newly diagnosed psychological disease, depression, psychosis, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse was 1438 (1.4%), 1268 (1.3%), 44 (0.0%), 173 (0.2%), and 2 (0.0%), respectively.\n",

    "3.1 Psychological disease among COVID‐19 survivors\n",
    "Table 2 shows the comparison results of the incidence of psychological disease between the COVID‐19 survivors and the control group. The incidence rate of psychological disease was higher in the COVID‐19 survivors (5.3%, 313 out of 5879) than that in the control group (1.2%, 1125 out of 93,863) with p < .001. In particular, COVID‐19 survivors showed a higher incidence of depression (COVID‐19 survivors: 4.9% [291 out of 5879] vs. control group: 1.0% [977 out of 93,868], p < .001), psychosis (COVID‐19 survivors: 0.2% [10 out of 5879] vs. control group: 0.0% [34 out of 93,868], p < .001), and alcohol abuse (COVID‐19 survivors: 0.4% [21 out of 5879] vs. control group: 0.2% [152 out of 93,868], p < .001) compared with the control group. However, the incidence of drug abuse was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 1.00). The risk ratios for psychologic disease, depression, psychoses, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse in the COVID‐19 survivors were 4.49 (95% CI: 3.97–5.07), 4.76 (95% CI: 4.18–5.41), 4.69 (95% CI: 2.32–9.50), 2.21 (95% CI: 1.40–3.48), and 3.19 (95% CI: 0.15–66.49), respectively. Table 3 shows the results of the multivariable logistic regression model for the development of psychological disease in South Korea. Compared to the control group, the COVID‐19 survivors had a 2.98‐fold higher odds of developing the psychological disease (OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 2.59–3.55; p < .001).\n",

    "4 DISCUSSION\n",
    "This population‐based cohort study in South Korea showed that COVID‐19 survivors were diagnosed with psychological diseases more frequently than the control population. Specifically, the COVID‐19 survivors had a higher risk of developing psychological diseases, such as depression and psychosis, independently compared to the control population. In the context of the current COVID‐19 pandemic situation, the findings of this study are deemed important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the exact mechanism of the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on the CNS is still unknown, many previous studies have reported that the infection plays a role in the development of CNS symptoms among COVID‐19 patients (Troyer et al., 2020). This theory was supported by some studies. Zhou et al. (2020) reported that in COVID‐19 patients diagnosed with viral encephalitis, gene sequencing analysis revealed the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the cerebrospinal fluid, confirming its neuroinvasive potential. Microscopically, in COVID‐19 patients, monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration in the vessel, ischemic neuronal changes, demyelination, and the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 viral particles and genome sequences in the brain were observed (Wu et al., 2020). As such, neurotropism and neuroinflammation in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been reported in previously published studies (Steardo et al., 2020). Thus, the neurological impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is known as a risk factor for the development of depression (Bakunina et al., 2015) and psychosis (Marques et al., 2019). A recent systemic review and meta‐analysis reported that survivors of severe coronavirus infection suffered from depression (10.5%), insomnia (12.1%), anxiety (12.3%), memory impairment (18.9%), fatigue (19.3%), and irritability (12.8%) during the post‐illness stage (Rogers et al., 2020). In addition to these findings, we found that the risk of depression and psychosis in the COVID‐19 survivors was 3.34‐fold and 2.49‐fold higher than that in the control population, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the impact of individual stress on the development of psychological sequelae among COVID‐19 survivors should be considered. The COVID‐19 pandemic made significant changes in lifestyles and interpersonal relationships, condemning many to prolonged periods of solitude and loneliness. These conditions of psychosocial stress could also have had a detrimental effect on the most fragile subjects, affecting their ability to modulate emotions (Berg‐Weger & Morley, 2020; Li et al., 2020). Moreover, individuals who were confirmed as COVID‐19‐positive have been reported to suffer from the stigma of COVID‐19 (Bagcchi, 2020; Singh & Subedi, 2020). A recent study reported that the COVID‐19 patients who were admitted to the hospital were at a higher risk of unemployment in Germany (Dragano et al., 2020). Unemployment is known to be a closely related factor to depression according to an epidemiological study (Dooley et al., 1994). Additionally, in South Korea, COVID‐19 patients are isolated for 10–14 days to avoid the transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2. This could lead to loneliness. Clearly, COVID‐19 patients might be at a higher risk of depression or psychosis, and this might affect the results of our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Zhang et al. conducted a plot and cross‐sectional study consisting of 205 participants in China. The study cohorts comprised 57 individuals with COVID‐19 infection, 50 individuals under quarantine, and 98 individuals in the general population (Zhang et al., 2020). In the study, there was an increase in the prevalence rate of depression (29.2%) among the patients who had COVID‐19 infection compared to individuals under quarantine. However, the patients in the general population showed a higher incidence of depression (34.7%) than the patients who had COVID‐19 infection. The study by Zhang et al. (2020) did not employ multivariable logistic regression analysis using covariate adjustment to determine whether an experience of COVID‐19 infection affects the incidence of depression. Indeed, age, sex, and marital status were significantly different across the groups in the study by Zhang et al. Another cohort study in Vietnam consisting of 3947 patients also reported that individuals with suspected COVID‐19 symptoms were more likely to be depressed (Nguyen et al., 2020). To compare these findings with the results of our study, different psychosocial circumstances across countries need to be considered. Psychosocial and socioeconomic crises have been reported in many countries as a result of the COVID‐19 pandemic (Bodrud‐Doza et al., 2020; Cerbara et al., 2020), and its effect on COVID‐19 patients might differ according to countries. For example, the Korean government pays for all medical charges for patients who are diagnosed with COVID‐19 to ensure that all patients can receive appropriate in‐hospital treatment for free. This might be associated with the lower incidence of psychological sequelae among COVID‐19 survivors in Korea, as compared to other countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychosis among COVID‐19 survivors is another important issue in our study. A previous study reported that immunoreactivity to coronavirus was observed in patients who had recent psychosis (Severance et al., 2011). Another retrospective cohort study reported that patients who were diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome experienced hallucinations and psychotic symptoms (Kim et al., 2018). Furthermore, there is a recent report that COVID‐19 increases the risk of schizophrenia in the elderly (Hu et al., 2020). Interestingly, the risk of psychoses was more evident in men than in women, with a higher OR of 6.48 (95% CI: 1.98–21.18) in men than of 1.49 (95% CI: 0.52–4.28) in women. The sexual difference in psychosis has been investigated in many published studies, but it was not definitively concluded yet (Riecher‐Rossler et al., 2018); however, it has been reported that men have a notable peak of incidence in late adolescence and a subsequent sharp decline in the middle age, while the peak age of incidence in women was during adolescence and after turning 45 (Jones, 2013). This suggests that the incidence of psychosis in men might be higher among young adults. Since a large number of young adults were confirmed to have COVID‐19 in South Korea from January to June 2020, our NHIS COVID‐19 cohort comprised a high proportion of young adults (41.1% of the 20 to 39‐year‐old population). Moreover, the total incidence of psychosis was as low as 0.0004% (44 out of 99,742); and among them, 38 patients were under the age of 39 years in our study. This should also be considered to comprehend our study's findings on psychosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some limitations to this study. First, some important variables, including the body mass index and lifestyle factors such as the history of smoking and alcohol consumption, were not included in the analysis because of the lack of such data in the NHIS database. Second, multivariable adjustment is known to reduce known and measured confounders. Therefore, there might be some residual confounders. Finally, to assess the Charlson comorbidity index, we defined comorbidities according to the ICD‐10 codes. However, in reality, the diseases specified by the ICD‐10 codes may differ from the actual underlying diseases in our study population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this population‐based cohort study showed that COVID‐19 survivors had a higher risk of developing the psychological disease compared to the control population in South Korea. In particular, an experience of COVID‐19 infection might increase the propensity for an individual to develop depression and psychosis.\"\"\"\n",

    "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in millions of patients infected worldwide and indirectly affecting even more individuals through disruption of daily living. Long-term adverse outcomes have been reported with similar diseases from other coronaviruses, namely Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Emerging evidence suggests that COVID-19 adversely affects different systems in the human body. This review summarizes the current evidence on the short-term adverse health outcomes and assesses the risk of potential long-term adverse outcomes of COVID-19. Major adverse outcomes were found to affect different body systems: immune system (including but not limited to Guillain-Barré syndrome and paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome), respiratory system (lung fibrosis and pulmonary thromboembolism), cardiovascular system (cardiomyopathy and coagulopathy), neurological system (sensory dysfunction and stroke), as well as cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations, impaired hepatic and renal function. Mental health in patients with COVID-19 was also found to be adversely affected. The burden of caring for COVID-19 survivors is likely to be huge. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop comprehensive strategies in providing resources and capacity in the healthcare system. Future epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the long-term impact on COVID-19 survivors.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) infection. As of 28 July 2020, 16,341,920 COVID-19 cases and 650,805 deaths worldwide have been reported [1]. While the global community is focusing on trialling COVID-19 vaccines and acute treatment, it is equally important to evaluate the long-term consequence of COVID-19 survivors. By 28 July 2020, 10,451,291 people had recovered from COVID-19 [2]. Despite the increasing number of recovered cases, there is rising concern regarding the sequelae following a diagnosis of COVID-19 [3]. Emerging evidence indicates COVID-19 has long-term consequences on the immunological and respiratory systems. Furthermore, since SARS-CoV-2 is a recently discovered novel virus, there is a lack of information on the long-term health outcomes of COVID-19 survivors. As the pathogens responsible for recent coronaviruses outbreaks, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), are similar in genome structures and are closely-related phylogenetically [4], long-term health outcomes of SARS and MERS may shed light on the long-term consequences of COVID-19. In this review, we summarize current evidence on the short-term adverse health outcomes and assess the risk of potential long-term adverse effects of COVID-19 referencing to long-term adverse outcomes of SARS and MERS. We will also recommend future research areas for long-term health outcomes of COVID-19 survivors.\n",

    "Search strategy, selection criteria and narrative review\n",
    "References were identified by conducting literature search using PubMed up till June 2020. Additional references were identified from the citations of relevant articles. Keywords used include COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV. Details of the keywords for each organ system are included in the supplementary material. The keywords were used in combination with MeSH terms to extend the comprehensiveness of the literature search. Only human studies were reviewed. No language restrictions were applied in the search. The references were included based on relevance to the topics of interest.\n",

    "We divided the narrative review into different sections according to organ class systems. The evidence of each section was reviewed by an expert clinician and two biomedical scientists. A narrative review of each section was written by the trios. The first author and corresponding author were responsible for summarizing all the information into the final manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrative review\n",
    "Immunological outcomes\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 is believed to induce much of its pathology through immune-mediated processes. Immunological consequences were extensively reported during the acute phase of illness, including lymphopenia, reduced peripheral blood T cells and increased plasma proinflammatory cytokines [5]. Historically, rheumatological and autoimmune-related adverse effects were manifested in patients following previous outbreaks, related but not limited to Zika, Ebola, Chikungunya and influenza viruses [6]. The most widely discussed theoretical explanation for such association between viral infection and the adverse immunological outcomes is suggested by molecular mimicry, the cross-talking of epitope between the host and the virus which favours the activation of autoreactive humoral or cell-mediated immunity. Other potential mechanisms to disrupt self-tolerance include bystander activation and damage, epitope spreading and the ineffective clearance of persistent viruses [6,7]. SARS-CoV-2 may induce its pathology through a similar mechanism, however, further studies are needed to support such hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guillain-Barré syndrome and paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome\n",
    "Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), where the hyperactive immune system attacks neurons as a para-infectious or post-infectious phenomenon, mainly manifesting as ascending muscle weakness, has been reported in over 30 case reports. Details are presented in Appendix. This phenomenon is consistent with preclinical studies that showed coronaviruses had the potential to induce demyelinating diseases [8]. To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the causal relationship between COVID-19 and GBS, and it is unknown if the neurological consequences of GBS could worsen the prognosis of the former. In children, despite their usual milder clinical course, cases of paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) which is a collection of Kawasaki-like disease, toxic shock syndrome and myocarditis, have been described [9]. More evidence is required to delineate whether COVID-19 occurred coincidentally or consequentially with autoimmune diseases and their natural history. There is an increasing number of case reports on GBS and PIMS among COVID-19 cases, with 52 cases and over 700 cases reported respectively. The published case reports are presented in the Appendix. However, as information on PIMS cases are too heterogeneous to generate informative summary statistics, while only case reports were published on GBS, future epidemiological studies are needed to investigate their incidences and monitor for any persistent adverse outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haematological complications\n",
    "In addition to GBS and PIMS, case reports of other autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases also suggest that there might be associations between COVID-19 and adverse immunological outcomes, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and antiphospholipid syndrome, affecting haemostasis as well as increasing the risk of thrombosis [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Two published studies detailed the rates of venous thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19. The incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe COVID-19 or requiring intensive care was reported as 25% in a study in China [11], and 31% in another study from the Netherlands [12]. Features of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and pulmonary embolism were also highly prevalent in COVID-19, where DIC has been observed in 71.4% of non-survivors [13]. The phenotype of pulmonary embolism in COVID-19 is observed to be different from conventional thromboembolism, and postulated to represent in situ immunothrombosis [14]. Whether pulmonary thromboembolism in COVID-19 resolves completely in survivors or poses long term sequelae of lung parenchymal or pulmonary vascular damage or pulmonary hypertension remains unknown. The haematological complications in patients with COVID-19 are also reflected in the cerebrovascular events observed, details are reported in the neurological section. As different ethnicities have different thrombotic risk [15], international studies are needed to investigate the varying risks of adverse outcomes in different ethnicities. Epidemiological studies with longer follow-up time are also needed to assess the long-term outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other autoimmune diseases and immunological consequences\n",
    "A cohort study using a national database of 17 million patients in the UK reported an increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23, [95% CI, 1.12-1.35]) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis [16]. Another review study hypothesized that COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of cancer in COVID-19 survivors due to impaired immune responses [17]. It is important to continue monitoring the occurrence of immunological and autoimmune diseases and evaluate the risk of cancer among COVID-19 survivors, which may take years to develop. Given the suggested linkage of COVID-19 and induced immunological diseases, long term epidemiological studies to identify new post-infectious immunological sequelae are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Respiratory outcomes\n",
    "The lungs remain the most common organ of serious injury as short-term outcomes of COVID-19, manifesting as pneumonia and respiratory failure which is the major cause of mortality in the acute phase [18]. Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 may have evidence of pneumonia on CT imaging [19]. Patients who survive are at risk of chronic respiratory complications. According to the British Thoracic Society Guidance on respiratory follow up of patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, those with severe conditions have a high prevalence of post-viral lung fibrosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, and attendant functional impairment [20].\n",
    "\n",
    "Available studies have consistently demonstrated that residual abnormalities on chest CT scans are present in many COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital 4–6 weeks after the onset of illness [19]. In a study of COVID-19 survivors in Italy, while 72.7% of the subjects developed interstitial pneumonia during hospitalization, up to 43.4% reported residual dyspnoea at around one month post-discharge, the second most prevalent symptom after fatigue (53.1%) [21], even though these latter symptoms may be multi-factorial and not solely due to lung damage. Early reports indicate that impairment of lung function test parameters, mainly the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, is seen at 4–6 weeks from the onset of illness in those who have recovered and discharged from hospital [22]. Details about pulmonary embolism and its persistence in COVID-19 survivors are reported in the section for immunological outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential long-term adverse respiratory outcomes\n",
    "From experience of previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS, radiologic abnormalities, impairment of pulmonary functions and reduced exercise capacity improved over time but may be persistent in some for months or even years [23,24]. Follow-up studies of SARS patients showed long-term persistent radiographic abnormalities in the lungs in a minority [24], while 33% of MERS survivors showed radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis at 82.4 ± 66 (mean ± SD) days after discharge [23]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that some COVID-19 patients may suffer from adverse respiratory outcomes despite recovery. Studies are needed to monitor the course of residual lung damage such as lung fibrosis, bronchiectasis or other structural abnormalities shown on radiologic imaging, and to estimate the impact of COVID-19 infection on subsequent lung health, pulmonary function, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life among survivors. Factors that determine persistent respiratory impairment in survivors are worthy of exploration, in particular the use of anti-viral agents, systemic corticosteroids, other immunomodulating or anti-inflammatory agents, advanced life support with invasive or non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular outcomes\n",
    "The high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on myocardial tissue renders cardiomyocytes highly susceptible to attack by SARS-CoV-2 [25]. Indeed, myocardial injury is an often reported cardiovascular complication of COVID-19, with an average incidence of 8-12% [26]. According to the National Health Commission of China, almost 12% of patients without known cardiovascular diseases (CVD) demonstrated an elevation in troponin levels or developed cardiac arrest during hospitalization [27].\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Wuhan cohort of 150 patients with COVID-19, myocardial damage and heart failure accounted for 40% of deaths [28]. In another cohort of 191 patients, heart failure occurred in 52% and 12% of patients who subsequently died and were discharged respectively [29]. Cardiac arrhythmia is another common cardiovascular manifestation of COVID-19. A study reported an overall incidence of 16.7% in 138 Chinese patients with COVID-19, with higher incidence of arrhythmia (44.4%) in those admitted to the ICU than those not requiring ICU admission (8.9%) [30]. In a cohort of 21 severe COVID-19 cases, one-third developed cardiomyopathy [31]. DIC was also observed in non-survivors of COVID-19, details are reported in the section for immunological outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential long-term adverse cardiovascular outcomes\n",
    "Even after recovery, heightened systemic inflammatory and pro-coagulant activity can persist long after resolution of the index infection which may lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the long-term. Previous meta-analysis and studies with long-term follow-up have shown that patients with community-acquired pneumonia are at significantly greater risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in the long run, even if they do not have underlying CVD at baseline [32]. Indeed, amongst 25 SARS survivors, 40% continued to have cardiovascular abnormalities at the 12-year follow-up [33]. It is likely that patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia will experience similar adverse outcomes. Interestingly, cardiovascular abnormalities observed during hospitalization in eight patients with H7N9 influenza returned to normal at 1-year follow-up [34]. Future longitudinal follow-up of COVID-19 survivors would be crucial to elucidate its long-term impact of COVID-19 and to protect these patients from future CVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gastrointestinal, hepatic and renal outcomes\n",
    "Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are often found in COVID-19 patients. The pooled prevalence of GI symptoms from 29 studies was found to be 15% [35], with up to 26% reported in some studies [36]. The most prevalent symptoms were diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal pain [35]. ACE2 receptors are also abundantly expressed on intestinal enterocytes, making them susceptible to attack by SARS-CoV-2 [36]. A study found that COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms had a similar rate of complications, pharmacological agents and supportive care received, hospitalizations and mortality as those without GI symptoms, indicating that GI symptoms are not a strong prognostic factor for outcomes in COVID-19 [37]. However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found in faecal specimens of 54% of COVID patients [35], and were continuously detected in 23.29% of the patients after negative results were seen in respiratory samples [38]. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may persist longer in enterocytes than in respiratory epithelial cells. Future epidemiological studies are needed to monitor for long-term adverse GI outcomes in COVID-19 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Published case studies have reported COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of liver dysfunction [35]. Liver injury primarily presented with aberrant elevation in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin levels [35]. The severity of COVID-19 has been suggested to be positively correlated with liver dysfunction in available data, where liver damage in mild cases of COVID-19 appears to be transient [35], with elevation in liver enzymes normalizing upon discharge or subsequent follow-up [39]. Liver involvement was also reported in SARS [40] and MERS [41] patients. However, no reports on their long-term outcomes have been found. With the paucity of data, it remains unclear whether such liver injury observed in COVID-19 as well as SARS and MERS infection were inflammation-mediated or from direct viral infection. A recent multi-centre North American matched cohort study showed that cirrhotic patients with COVID-19 had similar mortality to cirrhotic patients alone, and Charlson Comorbidity Index was the only independent predictor for mortality [42].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, kidney involvement is also prevalent in COVID-19 patients. Incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was around 0.5%–29% in patients with COVID-19 [43]. Along with proteinuria and haematuria, AKI was a risk factor for severity and mortality of COVID-19 [43]. In COVID-19 patients from Europe and the US who required intensive care, AKI was found in 20%–40% of these cases [44]. However, the actual incidence of AKI remains uncertain, as most studies did not report AKI stages nor had a clear definition of AKI. A clinical study is underway to investigate the incidence of renal outcomes in patients with COVID-19 three months post-hospital admission [45]. Kidney involvement was also found in SARS [46] and MERS [47] patients. However, no studies on the long-term renal outcomes have been reported. AKI significantly contributes to long-term outcomes such as microalbuminuria, and chronic kidney diseases that require dialysis [48]. As such, these outcomes should be monitored alongside investigation on the role of early initiation of renal replacement and sequential extracorporeal therapies in patients with COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurological outcomes\n",
    "Many studies have been published on the neurological impact of COVID-19. Olfactory and/or gustatory dysfunction are the most common neurological manifestations reported in patients with COVID-19 [49], with the pooled prevalence of 52.73% for olfactory dysfunction and 43.93% for gustatory dysfunction reported from a recent meta-analysis [50]. It is proposed that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor, which triggers a series of signalling cascades and potentially leads to different adverse neurological outcomes, e.g. olfactory dysfunction after entering the brain by systemic circulation or through the nasal cavity [51].\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also case reports on the occurrence of rare events such as stroke [52], GBS [53], and encephalitis/encephalopathy [54]. 57 cases of ischemic stroke and 9 cases of intracerebral haemorrhage were notified within the first three weeks of the launch of a nationwide surveillance system on neurological complications of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom (UK) [55]. Stroke was also found to be a poor prognostic factor in patients with COVID-19. A systematic review found that COVID-19 patients with stroke as a complication had a three times higher risk of death [56]. Another meta-analysis [57] also found that the severity of COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease. Details on GBS are reported in the above section for immunological outcomes. However, there is limited information on whether patients experiencing such symptoms have a higher risk of other severe neurological outcomes [8]. Population-based studies with longer follow-up time are needed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on rare but severe outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those neurological outcomes that can produce long-term complications, such as stroke and encephalitis which may seriously affect the patient's later quality of life [58], more studies on the risk factors of such complications, in the form of population-based studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up time are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dermatological outcomes\n",
    "Various cases of diverse dermatological manifestations of the COVID-19 have also been reported. The incidence of the cutaneous manifestation in COVID-19 patients varies in different case series, possibly due to the under-recognition of those asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic cases, ranges from 0.2% to 20.4% depending on regions of origin [59]. Proposed mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 affect dermatological system include direct viral attack on the epidermal basal cells and vasculature endothelial cells, with ACE2 expression in skin keratinocytes as possible target, and indirectly by the inflammatory response to the virus [60].\n",
    "\n",
    "A report of 88 COVID-19 patients in Italy showed 20.4% of them developed cutaneous manifestations, mostly involving erythematous rash, seen over a wide spectrum of clinical appearances including macular, papular, maculopapular, erythema-multiforme- like eruptions, [59]. Nearly half of the patients developed cutaneous symptoms at onset of disease. A nationwide surveillance system reported 375 cases of cutaneous lesions within two weeks during early April in Spain [61]. Maculopapular lesions were the most common presentations, making up nearly half of the cases. Pseudo-chilblain and urticarial lesions were the next most common presentations, each making up 19%, while vesicular lesions (9%) and livedo or necrosis (6%) making up the rest [61]. Cases of oral ulcers and blistering [62] and herpetiform lesions [63] were also reported. Dermatological manifestations were also reported in children. Rash is also a common manifestation in children with PIMS, mimicking Kawasaki-pattern. Details on PIMS are reported in the above section on immunological outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onset of adverse dermatological outcomes spanned across the course of COVID-19, ranging from presenting as the prodromal symptoms to a few days after systemic symptoms onset, or in the cases of PIMS, to delayed manifestations a few weeks after recovery for the infection [59,61,64]. A case-series of 22 patients who developed varicella-like exanthem during the course of COVID-19 reported onset from two days before to 12 days after systemic symptoms [64]. The duration of cutaneous symptoms were generally short and resolved within a few days [65]. Asymptomatic carriers would jeopardise the epidemiological control of disease in the communities. Recognition of the cutaneous symptoms as the first and sole manifestations of COVID-19 in some individuals [66] may help in early detection of disease, especially in areas when diagnostic kits are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the projection of long-term outcomes based on SARS and MERS, no reports of dermatological outcomes in both diseases were found. As dermatological examinations are often not routinely conducted in patients with coronaviruses, the prevalence of adverse dermatological outcomes in COVID-19 patients may be under-reported [61,62]. Larger epidemiological studies are needed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on rare but severe dermatological outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mental health outcomes\n",
    "On top of the immediate and long-term damage to the physical health brought by COVID-19 to patients, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound effect on the mental health of COVID-19 survivors across the globe [67]. The virus may infect the brain or trigger an immune response that causes additional adverse effects on brain functions and mental health [68]. Mental disorders might be the sequelae of brain damage that are either triggered directly from cerebral hypoxia caused by the viral infection [69], or indirectly from the immunological response or immunotherapy-induced adverse effects [70].\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential long-term adverse mental health outcomes\n",
    "As observed from previous large-scale coronavirus pandemics like SARS and MERS, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety disorder were much prevalent in patients with SARS or MERS at the post-illness stage [69]. The most common symptoms during the acute phase of illness among patients who were hospitalized for SARS or MERS were insomnia (41.9%), followed by impaired concentration or attention (38.2%), anxiety (35.7%), impaired memory (34.1%) and depressed mood (32.6%) [69].\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar findings were observed in studies conducted in different regions or countries at different timepoints during or post-pandemic [71–73]. In Hong Kong, compared to the baseline of 3% having psychiatric morbidities, a marked increase in the prevalence of mental disorders at 42.5% was found among SARS survivors at around 4-year post-SARS period, including PTSD (25.6%), depressive disorders (16.6%), anxiety disorder (15.5%), somatoform pain disorder (15.5%), panic disorder (13.8%) [72]. Chronic fatigue, associated with more comorbid active psychiatric disorders, was also found in 40.3% SARS survivors [72]. In South Korea, 54% of MERS survivors were reported to have at least one symptom of PTSD, depression, suicidality, or insomnia [73]. However, there were some common limitations among these studies, including small sample sizes, short follow-up time, and the outcome measurements were based on self-reported questionnaires or surveys instead of diagnosis given by the clinicians. Thus, the findings might not be a comprehensive reflection of the true phenomenon. High-quality international research is needed to systematically examine the mental health effects of the pandemic on COVID-19 patients in a longer term [67].\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential adverse maternal outcomes and long-term outcomes of prenatal exposure to COVID-19\n",
    "Previous reports in Hong Kong have portrayed associations of SARS with critical maternal illness such as multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation, miscarriage in early pregnancy, or maternal death [74]. In addition, studies have reported stillbirth and worsened prognosis in pregnant women infected with MERS [75]. A case report showed that two infants from five pregnant women with SARS presented growth retardation and two manifested GI complications [76]. A population-based cohort study conducted in the UK at the early stage of the pandemic reported that 5% of infants from mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, potentially contracted from their infected mothers [77]. While the current limited evidence does not seem to point to overtly poor immediate outcomes to children born to mothers with COVID-19, it is unclear whether there are any potential long-term effects [77]. Converging evidence from both clinical and preclinical research indicates that changes in the maternal gestational immune environment can alter foetal brain development and increase the risk for certain neurodevelopmental disorders [78]. As COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease which affects the immune system significantly in some patients, using an international big-data network will provide us with a large sample size to monitor and explore the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on children’s central nervous system, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Therefore, an international surveillance system must be developed to monitor the long-term outcomes of prenatal COVID-19 exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "Our review has found that COVID-19 has been reported with various adverse outcomes in different systems in the body. A lot of the adverse health effects were mediated by the activated immune system in response to the virus. GBS and PIMs were two of the immune-related syndromes that were more frequently reported. The activated immune system has also led to haematological complications in various forms, including ITP, antiphospholipid syndrome, affecting haemostasis or thrombosis, which in turn manifests in vascular diseases including pulmonary thromboembolism, haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke. Another concern arises from the activated immune system is the increase in risk of long-term adverse immunological outcomes, including autoimmune diseases and cancer. Adverse respiratory outcomes can be immune-mediated or due to the direct attack of the virus, including lung fibrosis and functional impairment, which has been found to persist beyond recovery from COVID-19 in some patients. Based on experience with SARS and MERS, impaired pulmonary function can persist years after recovery from infection, leading to reduced exercise capacity and quality of life. In the acute phase of the infection, we found reports of adverse cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial damage, heart failure, arrhythmia and adverse neurological outcome including olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Based on experience with other pneumonia, cardiovascular abnormalities and elevated risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events persists beyond a decade after the infection. For adverse dermatological, gastrointestinal, hepatic and renal outcomes, only complications during the acute phase of the infection were reported. No reports of their long-term outcomes in SARS and MERS survivors were found. Adverse mental health outcomes were also reported during the pandemics, including insomnia, anxiety, and depressed mood. Increase in risk of some adverse mental health outcomes could persist years after recovery from infection, including chronic fatigue, PTSD, depression, anxiety, panic disorder etc. The adverse outcomes we found and their potential long-term outcomes from direct exposure and prenatal exposures calls for comprehensive and long-term care and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-infection care for COVID-19 survivors is likely to add an extra burden to the healthcare system. It was reported that healthcare utilization of a thousand SARS survivors in Hong Kong during the first year after hospital discharge was substantial, with over 5,000 attendances for consultations in primary care clinics and diagnostic tests, including chest radiographs and blood tests [79]. Some patients required inpatient rehabilitation or underwent surgical procedures over the course of the follow-up year [79]. Assuming a similar impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilization, the estimated additional numbers of clinic visits and diagnostic tests will be over 45 million among the current 9 million recovered COVID-19 patients worldwide (to July 2020). Given increasing numbers of recovered COVID-19 patients and aging compared to the time of the SARS outbreak, it is likely that the extent to which follow-up healthcare services are adopted for COVID-19 survivors will be much greater than for SARS globally. Prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, defined as a duration of more than 96 h to 21 days of ventilation or longer, is associated with higher mortality rates and increased healthcare utilization [80]. Given the extensive use of mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19 patients, post-infection healthcare utilization is projected to be substantial in these survivors. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop a comprehensive strategy in providing resources and capacity in caring for COVID-19 survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of COVID-19 survivors have less than six months of follow-up after recovery; hence there is no data on long-term outcomes of COVID-19 survivors or the children with pre-natal exposure of SARS-CoV-2. Taking the above knowledge gaps into consideration, it is clear that methodologically, clinical trials will not be sufficient to resolve all questions on the long-term physical health and mental health outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and children with prenatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the application of epidemiological and statistical techniques using large clinical and administrative records databases is the most appropriate option to evaluate the long-term health outcomes of COVID-19. Big data analytics will enable evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 to better understand the outcomes of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of COVID-19. This will enable us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the immediate impact of COVID-19 on individual patients. Such analytics could also identify the risk factors of poor outcomes, which will enable the development of strategies to protect patients who are most vulnerable to severe illness. Initiatives such as International COVID-19 Data Research Alliance and Workbench and OHDSI – Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics will significantly enhance the capacity of research in long-term outcomes of COVID-19 and also, more importantly, avoid unnecessary duplications of effort and wasted precious resources. Such initiatives could provide empirical evidence from healthcare big data to introduce evidence-based clinical practice for patients post-COVID-19 care. The information extracted would give educators and policymakers a high contrast full picture illustration of the impact of a pandemic on the holistic development of COVID-19 survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the available literature are case reports, data from surveillance systems or studies with limited cohort size or relatively short study period or follow-up time. The study design and the small number of cases in each report gives insufficient power to allow for proper quantitative analysis to draw statistically meaningful and generalisable conclusion. This review referenced some meta-analyses of other reports to provide an overview of a specific adverse outcome. However, due to the sheer volume and variety of papers and data available, it was not possible to use checklists to assess the accuracy or quality of each article whether they are meta-analyses or case reports. This is a major limitation of our review; inevitably all narrative reviews subject to the same limitation. Nevertheless, in order to enhance the validity of our narrative review, each section was written by subject specialist. Such strategy aims to make use of the specialist knowledge to select more appropriate information under the current limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This review of current evidence on the short-term and potential long-term health outcomes of COVID-19 showed that multiple organ systems as well as mental health are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The burden of caring for COVID-19 survivors are likely to be huge. Therefore, it is important for policy makers to develop a comprehensive strategy in providing resources and capacity in the healthcare system. Future epidemiological studies are needed to further investigate the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and monitor the long-term health impact.\"\"\"\n",

    "The lung scans were the first sign of trouble. In the early weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, clinical radiologist Ali Gholamrezanezhad began to notice that some people who had cleared their COVID-19 infection still had distinct signs of damage. “Unfortunately, sometimes the scar never goes away,” he says.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gholamrezanezhad, at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his team started tracking patients in January using computed tomography (CT) scanning to study their lungs. They followed up on 33 of them more than a month later, and their as-yet-unpublished data suggest that more than one-third had tissue death that has led to visible scars. The team plans to follow the group for several years.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patients are likely to represent the worst-case scenario. Because most infected people do not end up in hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says the overall rate of such intermediate-term lung damage is likely to be much lower — his best guess is that it is less than 10%. Nevertheless, given that 28.2 million people are known to have been infected so far, and that the lungs are just one of the places that clinicians have detected damage, even that low percentage implies that hundreds of thousands of people are experiencing lasting health consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctors are now concerned that the pandemic will lead to a significant surge of people battling lasting illnesses and disabilities. Because the disease is so new, no one knows yet what the long-term impacts will be. Some of the damage is likely to be a side effect of intensive treatments such as intubation, whereas other lingering problems could be caused by the virus itself. But preliminary studies and existing research into other coronaviruses suggest that the virus can injure multiple organs and cause some surprising symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative COVID-19 test does not mean recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "People with more severe infections might experience long-term damage not just in their lungs, but in their heart, immune system, brain and elsewhere. Evidence from previous coronavirus outbreaks, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, suggests that these effects can last for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "And although in some cases the most severe infections also cause the worst long-term impacts, even mild cases can have life-changing effects — notably a lingering malaise similar to chronic fatigue syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many researchers are now launching follow-up studies of people who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of these focus on damage to specific organs or systems; others plan to track a range of effects. In the United Kingdom, the Post-Hospitalisation COVID-19 Study (PHOSP-COVID) aims to follow 10,000 patients for a year, analysing clinical factors such as blood tests and scans, and collecting data on biomarkers. A similar study of hundreds of people over 2 years launched in the United States at the end of July.\n",
    "\n",
    "What they find will be crucial in treating those with lasting symptoms and trying to prevent new infections from lingering. “We need clinical guidelines on what this care of survivors of COVID-19 should look like,” says Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious-diseases clinician at Boston University School of Medicine in Massachusetts, who is setting up a clinic to support people with COVID-19. “That can’t evolve until we quantify the problem.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Enduring effects\n",
    "In the first few months of the pandemic, as governments scrambled to stem the spread by implementing lockdowns and hospitals struggled to cope with the tide of cases, most research focused on treating or preventing infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctors were well aware that viral infections could lead to chronic illness, but exploring that was not a priority. “At the beginning, everything was acute, and now we’re recognizing that there may be more problems,” says Helen Su, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. “There is a definite need for long-term studies.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious place to check for long-term harm is in the lungs, because COVID-19 begins as a respiratory infection. Few peer-reviewed studies exploring lasting lung damage have been published. Gholamrezanezhad’s team analysed lung CT images of 919 patients from published studies1, and found that the lower lobes of the lungs are the most frequently damaged. The scans were riddled with opaque patches that indicate inflammation, that might make it difficult to breathe during sustained exercise. Visible damage normally reduced after two weeks1. An Austrian study also found that lung damage lessened with time: 88% of participants had visible damage 6 weeks after being discharged from hospital, but by 12 weeks, this number had fallen to 56% (see go.nature.com/3hiiopi).\n",

    "\n",
    "Symptoms might take a long time to fade; a study2 posted on the preprint server medRxiv in August followed up on people who had been hospitalized, and found that even a month after being discharged, more than 70% were reporting shortness of breath and 13.5% were still using oxygen at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence from people infected with other coronaviruses suggests that the damage will linger for some. A study3 published in February recorded long-term lung harm from SARS, which is caused by SARS-CoV-1. Between 2003 and 2018, Peixun Zhang at Peking University People’s Hospital in Beijing and his colleagues tracked the health of 71 people who had been hospitalized with SARS. Even after 15 years, 4.6% still had visible lesions on their lungs, and 38% had reduced diffusion capacity, meaning that their lungs were poor at transferring oxygen into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 often strikes the lungs first, but it is not simply a respiratory disease, and in many people, the lungs are not the worst-affected organ. In part, that’s because cells in many different locations harbour the ACE2 receptor that is the virus’s major target, but also because the infection can harm the immune system, which pervades the whole body.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 could be left with a weakened immune system. Many other viruses are thought to do this. “For a long time, it’s been suggested that people who have been infected with measles are immunosuppressed in an extended period and are vulnerable to other infections,” says Daniel Chertow, who studies emerging pathogens at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. “I’m not saying that would be the case for COVID, I’m just saying there’s a lot we don’t know.” SARS, for instance, is known to decrease immune-system activity by reducing the production of signalling molecules called interferons4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thousands of people will help scientists to track the long-term health effects of the coronavirus crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "Su and her colleagues hope to enrol thousands of people worldwide in a project called the COVID Human Genetic Effort, which aims to find genetic variants that compromise people’s immune systems and make them more vulnerable to the virus. They plan to expand the study to those with long-term impairment, hoping to understand why their symptoms persist and to find ways to help them. “Someone who has prolonged problems, beyond what would be normally seen, they would be of interest to study,” says Su.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virus can also have the opposite effect, causing parts of the immune system to become overactive and trigger harmful inflammation throughout the body. This is well documented in the acute phase of the illness, and is implicated in some of the short-term impacts. For instance, it might explain why a small number of children with COVID-19 develop widespread inflammation and organ problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This immune over-reaction can also happen in adults with severe COVID-19, and researchers want to know more about the knock-on effects after the virus has run its course. “It seems there’s a lag there for it to get hold of the person and then cause this severe inflammation,” says Adrienne Randolph, a senior associate in critical-care medicine at Boston Children’s Hospital. “But then the thing is that, long term, when they recover, how long does it take the immune system to settle back to normality?”\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart of the matter\n",
    "An over-reactive immune system can lead to inflammation, and one particularly susceptible organ is the heart. During the acute phase of COVID-19, about one-third of patients show cardiovascular symptoms, says Mao Chen, a cardiologist at Sichuan University in Chengdu, China. “It’s absolutely one of the short-term consequences.”\n",
    "\n",
    "One such symptom is cardiomyopathy, in which the muscles of the heart become stretched, stiff or thickened, affecting the heart’s ability to pump blood. Some patients also have pulmonary thrombosis, in which a clot blocks a blood vessel in the lungs. The virus can also injure the wider circulatory system, for instance, by infecting the cells lining blood vessels5.\n",

    "\n",
    "“My major concern is also the long-term impact,” says Chen. In some patients, he says, the risk to the cardiovascular system “lingers for a long time”. Chen and his colleagues reviewed data from before the pandemic for a study6 published in May, noting that people who have had pneumonia are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease 10 years later — although the absolute risk is still small. Chen speculates that an over-reactive immune system, and the resulting inflammation, might be involved. However, there is little information on long-term cardiovascular harms from SARS or the related disease Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), let alone from SARS-CoV-2.\n",

    "Studies are now starting. At the beginning of June, the British Heart Foundation in London announced six research programmes, one of which will follow hospitalized patients for six months, tracking damage to their hearts and other organs. Data-sharing initiatives such as the CAPACITY registry, launched in March, are compiling reports from dozens of European hospitals about people with COVID-19 who have cardiovascular complications.\n",

    "How COVID-19 can damage the brain\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar long-term studies are needed to understand the neurological and psychological consequences of COVID-19. Many people who become severely ill experience neurological complications such as delirium, and there is evidence that cognitive difficulties, including confusion and memory loss, persist for some time after the acute symptoms have cleared. But it is not clear whether this is because the virus can infect the brain, or whether the symptoms are a secondary consequence — perhaps of inflammation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chronic fatigue\n",
    "One of the most insidious long-term effects of COVID-19 is its least understood: severe fatigue. Over the past nine months, an increasing number of people have reported crippling exhaustion and malaise after having the virus. Support groups on sites such as Facebook host thousands of members, who sometimes call themselves “long-haulers”. They struggle to get out of bed, or to work for more than a few minutes or hours at a time. One study7 of 143 people with COVID-19 discharged from a hospital in Rome found that 53% had reported fatigue and 43% had shortness of breath an average of 2 months after their symptoms started. A study of patients in China showed that 25% had abnormal lung function after 3 months, and that 16% were still fatigued8.\n",

    "Profile of a killer: the complex biology powering the coronavirus pandemic\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul Garner, a infectious-disease researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK, has experienced this at first hand. His initial symptoms were mild, but he has since experienced “a roller coaster of ill health, extreme emotions and utter exhaustion”. His mind became “foggy” and new symptoms cropped up almost every day, ranging from breathlessness to arthritis in his hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "These symptoms resemble chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). The medical profession has struggled for decades to define the disease — leading to a breakdown of trust with some patients. There are no known biomarkers, so it can only be diagnosed based on symptoms. Because the cause is not fully understood, it is unclear how to develop a treatment. Dismissive attitudes from doctors persist, according to some patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "People reporting chronic fatigue after having COVID-19 describe similar difficulties. In the forums, many long-haulers say they have received little or no support from doctors — perhaps because many of them showed only mild symptoms, or none at all, and were never hospitalized or in danger of dying. It will not be easy to establish the links between COVID-19 and fatigue with certainty, says Randolph. Fatigue does not seem to be limited to severe cases. It is common in people who had mild symptoms and who therefore might not have been tested for the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only way to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 is behind these symptoms is to compare people known to have had the virus with those who have not, says Chertow, to see how often fatigue manifests and in what form. Otherwise there is a risk of lumping together people whose fatigue has manifested for different reasons, and who might need distinct treatments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chertow says he is not aware of such a study for COVID-19, but they have been done for other diseases. Following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014–16, US researchers collaborated with the Ministry of Health in Liberia to perform a long-term follow-up study9 called Prevail III. The study identified six long-term impacts from Ebola, ranging from joint pain to memory loss. Bhadelia, who treated hundreds of people with Ebola during the outbreak, says that these post-viral symptoms had not previously been recognized. Usually, she says, “we don’t stick around past the acute stage. We don’t look at the long tail of recovery. It’s important to do that, because it tells you more about the virus and its pathophysiology.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is clearer for people who have been severely ill with COVID-19, especially those who ended up on ventilators, says Chertow. In the worst cases, patients experience injury to muscles or the nerves that supply them, and often face “a really long-fought battle on the order of months or up to years” to regain their previous health and fitness, he says. He and his colleagues are now recruiting people with COVID-19 from across the severity spectrum for a long-term follow-up study, assessing their brains, lungs, hearts, kidneys and inflammation responses while they are acutely ill, then during recovery a few weeks later, and again after 6–12 months (see go.nature.com/3mfqqxc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, there is evidence from SARS that coronavirus infection can cause long-term fatigue. In 2011, Harvey Moldofsky and John Patcai at the University of Toronto in Canada described 22 people with SARS, all of whom remained unable to work 13–36 months after infection10. Compared with matched controls, they had persistent fatigue, muscle pain, depression and disrupted sleep. Another study11, published in 2009, tracked people with SARS for 4 years and found that 40% had chronic fatigue. Many were unemployed and had experienced social stigmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear how viruses might do this damage, but a 2017 review12 of the literature on chronic fatigue syndrome found that many patients have persistent low-level inflammation, possibly triggered by infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If COVID-19 is such a trigger, a wave of psychological effects “may be imminent”, write a group of researchers led by Declan Lyons, a psychiatrist at St Patrick’s Mental Health Services in Dublin13. The ME Association, a UK-based charity, says it has received many reports of previously healthy people whose energy levels have not returned to normal after becoming infected with the virus, and expects to see new cases of chronic fatigue syndrome. In many countries, the pandemic shows no sign of waning, and health systems are already at capacity responding to acute cases. Nevertheless, researchers say it is crucial to start digging into the long-term effects now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the answers will not come quickly. “The problem is,” says Gholamrezanezhad, “to assess long-term consequences, the only thing you need is time.”\"\"\"\n",

    "Magnetic resonance (MR) studies suggested cardiac involvement post‐Covid‐19 in a significant subset of affected individuals, including athletes. This brings serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in‐depth cardiac screening in athletes after Covid‐19 before return to play. The aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid‐19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes. This was a retrospective cohort study, in which 26 consecutive elite athletes (national team, Olympians, top national league players; median age 24 years, interquartile range [IQR] 21–27, 81% female) were included. At 1.5 T including balanced steady‐state free precession cine imaging, T1 and T2‐mapping using Myomaps software (Siemens), dark‐blood T2‐weighted images with fat suppression, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with phase‐sensitive inversion recovery sequence were used. The athletes had mainly asymptomatic or mild course of the disease (77%). They were scanned after a median of 32 days (IQR 22–62 days) from the diagnosis. MR data were reviewed by three independent observers, each with >10 years cardiac MR experience. Native T1, T2, extracellular volume, and T2 signal intensity ratio were calculated. Diagnosis of acute myocarditis was based on modified Lake Louise criteria. Statistical analyses used were Pearson correlation and Bland–Altman repeatability analysis. At the time of MR the athletes had no pathologic electrocardiogram abnormalities or elevated troponin levels. MR did not reveal any case of acute myocarditis. Cardiac abnormalities were found in five (19%) athletes, including four athletes presenting borderline signs of isolated myocardial edema and one athlete showing nonischemic LGE with pleural and pericardial effusion. Another athlete had signs of persistent lung congestion without cardiac involvement. We have shown that in a small group of elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid‐19, lack of electrocardiographic changes, and normal troponin concentration 1–2 months after the diagnosis, there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities as assessed by cardiac MR.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) has been shown to affect various organs of the human body.1 Although other coronaviruses do not typically show cardiac tropism, due to its unique structure, SARS‐CoV‐2 has been demonstrated to affect the heart directly and indirectly.2 The virus can directly invade cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells leading to myocarditis, myocardial infarction, life‐threatening arrhythmias, and acute and/or chronic heart failure.1, 2 SARS‐CoV‐2 can also indirectly injure the heart through stimulation of systemic inflammatory and immunologic reaction.1, 2 It was initially thought that the frequency of cardiac involvement resulting from SARS‐CoV disease (Covid‐19) correlated with the severity of the clinical course of the disease and the presence of comorbidities.3 Supporting that, an MR study by Huang et al. in patients who reported cardiac symptoms disclosed abnormal findings in 58% of patients.4 However, more recent MR studies of individuals recovered from Covid‐19 have demonstrated a high frequency of cardiac involvement despite an asymptomatic or benign course of the disease.5, 6 A study by Puntmann et al. has shown that 2–3 months post infection 78% of patients, of whom 18% were asymptomatic and 49% had mild to moderate symptoms, presented abnormal cardiac MR findings and 60% demonstrated an ongoing inflammation.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Myocarditis can lead to serious complications including life‐threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and/or acute and chronic heart failure, with exercise being one of the factors which may worsen the course of the disease as demonstrated in animal studies.7 Experts in sports cardiology recommend in‐depth cardiac screening before returning to sport only in athletes with prolonged recovery from Covid‐19, limiting testing to 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography, or even a direct return to play in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic athletes.8, 9 Studies in athletes recovered from Covid‐19 to date have demonstrated a variable frequency of cardiac involvement despite asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic course. A COVID‐19 Myocardial Pathology Evaluation in AthleTEs with Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (COMPETE‐CMR) study reported fibrosis (other than insertion point) in 5% of athletes, with only 3% of them meeting MR criteria for myocarditis,10 while a study by Rajpal et al. has shown signs of myocarditis in 15% of athletes and further 30% of them presenting isolated myocardial fibrosis suggestive of previous injury.6 In both studies there was no clear correlation between symptoms and cardiac involvement. Anxiety has been further increased by the recent death of a 27‐year‐old professional basketball player who suffered a sudden cardiac death during training shortly after recovery from Covid‐19.2 There are consequently serious clinical concerns regarding the potential need for in‐depth cardiologic screening in all athletes after COVID‐19 before they can be safely allowed to fully return to training and competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the aim of this study was to gain further insight into the relation between Covid‐19 and cardiac involvement in professional athletes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Ethical Considerations\n",
    "The tests were part of a routine clinical assessment before full return to training and competition mandated by the National Centre for Sports Medicine, a partner of the Polish Olympic Team, in light of the reports showing high frequency of cardiac involvement in individuals recovering from Covid‐19, including asymptomatic cases. The study received local Ethical Committee approval for retrospective analysis of clinical data (no. IK.NPIA.0021.78.1983/20).\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Group\n",
    "Twenty‐six consecutive, Caucasian elite athletes who were members of the Polish National Olympic Team and top league professional volleyball and football clubs and tested positive for Covid‐19 with a real‐time polymerase chain reaction test between August and October 2020 were included. They represented different sport categories, including strength (wrestling, judo, sprint athletics), mixed (soccer, volleyball), and skill disciplines (fencing). All athletes underwent an MR of the heart as soon as possible in terms of safety and logistics after Covid‐19 infection. Additional tests performed on the day of the MR scan were detailed physical examination, resting ECG, and laboratory tests, including whole blood count and markers of inflammation (C‐reactive protein [CRP]) and cardiac injury (high‐sensitive [hs] troponin T) using standardized equipment (Cobas 800, Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The local detection limit for hs‐troponin T was 4 pg/ml and for CRP 0.60 mg/L. The 99th percentile upper cut‐off value for hs‐troponin T was 13.90 pg/ml and the upper limit of normality for CRP was 5 mg/L.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mild Covid‐19 was defined as the presence of nonspecific and self‐limited fatigue, anosmia or ageusia, and/or typical mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection, including headache, cough, sore throat, nasopharyngeal congestion, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Moderate disease was defined as symptoms persisting over 7 days and including fever or chills, hypoxia or pneumonia, and/or cardiovascular symptoms such as dyspnea and/or chest pain, tightness or pressure at rest or during exertion. Severe disease was defined as one requiring hospitalization.11\n",
    "\n",
    "MR Protocol and Analysis\n",
    "MR imaging was performed with a Siemens Magnetom Avanto Fit 1.5 Tesla scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The protocol included initial scout images, followed by cine balanced steady‐state free precession (bSSFP) breath‐hold sequences in two‐, three‐, and four‐chamber views. Short axis was identified using the two‐ and four‐chamber images and a stack of images was acquired which included the ventricles from the mitral and tricuspid valvular plane to the apex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precontrast T1‐mapping with modified Look Locker sequence and T2‐mapping were performed with a T2‐prepared SSFP sequence immediately after acquisition of the bSSFP cine images and processed using MyoMaps software (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For that purpose, three short axis slices (one basal, one mid‐ventricular, and one apical) and two‐, three‐, and four‐chamber views were obtained. Subsequently an acquisition of dark‐blood T2‐weighted images with fat suppression in the same orientations was performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these acquisitions, 0.1 mmol/kg of a gadolinium contrast agent (gadobutrol—Gadovist, Bayer Shering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) was administered and flushed with 30 ml of isotonic saline. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images in three long axis and a stack of short‐axis imaging planes were obtained with a breath‐hold phase‐sensitive inversion recovery sequence 10 min after the contrast injection. The inversion time was adjusted to null normal myocardium (typically between 250 and 350 ms as assessed by means of a TI‐scout acquisition). This was followed by a postcontrast T1‐mapping acquisition 15 min after the contrast injection in the same orientations as the precontrast T1‐mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images were analyzed with the use of dedicated software (Syngovia, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). All studies were assessed independently by three physicians—one cardiologist and two radiologists, each with long‐lasting expertise in cardiac MR (Ł.A.M—13 years of experience, M.M. and B.M‐W.—12 years of experience). End‐diastolic and end‐systolic endocardial and epicardial contours were drawn semi‐automatically for the left ventricle (LV) and manually for the right ventricle (RV) in the short axis stack of bSSFP cine acquisitions. Delineated contours were used for the quantification of end‐diastolic (LVEDVI/RVEDVI) and end‐systolic volumes (LVESVI/RVESVI), stroke volumes (LVSVI/RVESVI), ejection fraction (LVEF/RVEF), and LV mass (LVMI), indexed to body surface area. We used previously published normal values of left and right ventricular volumes, systolic function and mass as a reference.12\n",
    "\n",
    "Precontrast T1 and T2 relaxation times, T2 signal intensity (T2 SI) ratios and postcontrast T1 relaxation times were calculated from a 1.0 cm2 region of interest (ROI) placed in the mid‐ventricular short‐axis slice in the mid‐section of the interventricular septum avoiding the RV/LV insertion points. Caution was taken not to include LGE areas in the measurements and not to include blood pool in the ROI. For blood pool pre‐ and postcontrast T1 calculation, a ROI of the same size was placed at the same level in the ventricular cavity, but separate from the papillary muscles or trabeculations. For T2 SI ratio, a ROI in the skeletal muscles of the chest of the same size was used. Extracellular volume (ECV) was calculated using the previously validated equation: ECV = (1 − hematocrit) × ([1/T1myopost − 1/T1myopre]/[1/T1bloodpost − 1/T1bloodpre]).13\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence and location of LGE was assessed visually. Junction point (insertion/hinge point) LGE in isolation was not considered as pathologic and therefore was not reported.14 Abnormal native T1 and T2 values were defined as greater than 1054 ms and greater than 50 ms, respectively, based on previously derived sequence and scanner‐specific cut‐offs of 2 standard deviations (SDs) above the respective means in a healthy population.15 Increase of myocardial T2 SI ratio was defined as a signal intensity ratio of the LV myocardium to skeletal muscle ≥2.0.16 Acute myocarditis was diagnosed according to the updated Lake Louise criteria using a T2‐based criterion in combination with a T1‐based criterion.17 Abnormal ECV values were defined as >31.9%, which is 2 SDs above the mean observed in previous study of athletes.18\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Methods\n",
    "All results for categorical variables were presented as a number and a percentage. Continuous variables were expressed as mean and SD or median and interquartile range (IQR), depending on the normality of the distributions assessed with the use of the chi‐square test. Inter‐reader variability was assessed in 10 randomly chosen athletes using Pearson correlation test and Bland–Altman repeatability analysis between two readers (cardiologist and one of the radiologists). All tests were two‐sided with the significance level of p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with MedCalc statistical software 10.0.2.0 (Ostend, Belgium).\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Baseline Characteristics\n",
    "Our study group consisted mainly of female athletes (81%) representing wrestling, sprint athletics and fencing (Table 1). Male athletes included soccer and volleyball players and one wrestler. Most of the athletes were asymptomatic (23%) or mildly symptomatic (54%) during the course of Covid‐19. One female athlete with fever and myalgia was shortly hospitalized due to pulmonary changes observed in a computed tomography scan, but did not need respiratory support or have any noticeable cardiac abnormalities at that time as determined by ECG, echocardiography, and markers of myocardial injury. Other athletes spent the time of infection in self‐isolation and did not train. ECG and laboratory tests performed on the day of the MR scan did not disclose any abnormalities. Detectable values of hs‐troponin T and CRP were found in four (15%) of athletes. The median time between diagnosis and MR was 32 days (IQR 22–62 days).\n",

    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "In a group of 26 elite athletes with mostly asymptomatic or mild course of Covid‐19 we have demonstrated lack of criteria for an active myocarditis by MR performed after 1–2 months from the diagnosis. Abnormal cardiac MR findings, which could not be directly ascribed to physiological adaptation to exercise, were disclosed in one fifth of the athletes. These included mainly isolated signs of myocardial edema on T2‐mapping or borderline raised T2 SI ratio.16, 17 Otherwise studied athletes presented changes, which could be explained by physiological adaptation to exercise (the so called athlete's heart).19\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolated myocardial edema (especially borderline) without other markers of acute myocarditis or any other cardiac abnormalities on MR and with normal levels of markers of myocardial injury in an asymptomatic individual should be considered with caution in terms of its impact on management for several reasons. First of all, it has been shown that isolated myocardial edema has only a limited specificity as a marker of biopsy‐proven myocarditis.20 Second, transient myocardial edema has been previously observed shortly after running a marathon and was fully reversible at 3 months without complications and interruption of physical activity.21 Finally, and most importantly, isolated myocardial edema without fibrosis has not been shown to independently affect prognosis in patients with suspected myocarditis.22, 23 Therefore in our opinion, in cases of asymptomatic individuals with negative troponin levels, normal ECG and normal LVEF, isolated signs of myocardial edema do not justify a change of management. In the case of an athlete recovered from Covid‐19, our findings should not be used as a sole indication to withhold an athlete from training and/or competition.\n",

    "On the contrary, the presence of LGE in the myocardium irrespective of its localization and pattern, except junction point fibrosis, has been persistently linked to worse prognosis.24 In our study, only one patient with moderate symptoms had nonischemic fibrosis, which could be linked to recent Covid‐19 as supported by pericardial and pleural effusion, but could also be a marker of previous silent myocarditis or other causes. This pattern of fibrosis is not infrequently observed in asymptomatic athletes even without a history of prior myocarditis.14, 25 In any case, it should warrant further management to exclude the risk of inherited cardiomyopathy and/or arrhythmias of other origin consisting of at least detailed family history, 24‐h‐Holter monitoring and maximal exercise testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our findings, despite one suspicious case, are reassuring for athletes who have recently recovered from asymptomatic or mild Covid‐19 and who have absence of increased troponin or ECG changes 1–2 months after the infection. All athletes gradually resumed training and safely returned to play. Our findings support the published American guidelines on the management of athletes post Covid‐19, obviating the need for cardiac testing before return to play in asymptomatic or mild cases and limiting comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including MR, to moderate cases with signs of cardiac involvement in first‐line tests (ECG, echocardiography, troponin).9 In line with that, echocardiography performed in the athlete with LGE from our study would have also disclosed pericardial effusion and provided an indication for a cardiac MR study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results are in contrast with some cardiac MR studies in the general population and athletes recovered from Covid‐19. In a study by Puntmann et al. on 100 mainly asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients without increased troponin concentration after a mean of 2–3 months from diagnosis, cardiac abnormalities were found in over 70% of cases.5 This could be related to the higher age of their study patients and the more frequent presence of cardiovascular and other risk factors or even to a low threshold for defining abnormality or other methodological issues raised in commentaries to the study.26 These concerns are supported by findings on hospitalized patients with Covid‐19 with significantly increased troponin who also had about 70% frequency of abnormal MR findings in the heart.27 However, these patients represented the upper end of the Covid‐19 spectrum of disease severity and not the lower end as in the study by Puntmann et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study on collegiate athletes, by definition younger and healthier than the general population, has demonstrated signs of an active myocarditis in 15% of athletes and further 30% of them showing isolated myocardial fibrosis suggestive of previous injury.6 The discrepancy between our results and the results of this study could potentially be explained by sex differences in the athletes studied (all male vs. mainly females in our study). Females have been shown to have a more benign clinical course of the disease, which may be due to females eliciting stronger immune responses to pathogens and/or the influence of sex hormones.28 In a second American study on athletes post‐Covid‐19, which reported a 3% frequency of active myocarditis there was also a predominance of female athletes.10 Finally, a difference between our results and previous cardiac MR studies on athletes post‐Covid‐19 could also be influenced by geographic or ethnical differences in the course of the disease.29\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the athletes from our study demonstrated isolated pulmonary changes, which could potentially be linked to the Covid‐19 infection. Studies with the use of computed tomography, have confirmed the risk of long‐term pulmonary changes postinfection.30 Importantly, despite this isolated extracardiac finding, we do not recommend cardiac MR to detect pulmonary changes due to much lower sensitivity than computed tomography.31 However, we suggest that when performing a cardiac MR study on patients recovered from Covid‐19, assessment for potential pulmonary changes should be given particular attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "First, our study was based on a relatively few subjects. However, the sample size was similar to some previously published studies with MR on athletes recovered from Covid‐196 and data in this study group are highly needed. Second, due to time constraints and pandemic restrictions, our study lacked a matched control group. Therefore, we could not assess what percentage of elite athletes without the history of Covid‐19 would also have myocardial edema or small pleural/pericardial effusions on cardiac MR. However, we report similar adaptive changes to sport in terms of ventricular enlargement, ECV, and prevalence of LGE as in a previous study on middle‐age endurance athletes.18 Last, we were also unable to present any clinical follow‐up to assess the prognosis of the presented findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "We have demonstrated that in elite athletes with mainly asymptomatic to mild Covid‐19, lack of electrocardiographic changes and normal troponin concentration after a 1–2 months from the diagnosis there were no signs of acute myocarditis, but 19% of athletes had some abnormalities mostly nonlimiting them from return to play as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance. Our results may support the proposed return to play guidelines recommending limited testing in this group of athletes.\n",

    "Objective/Hypothesis\n",
    "With the COVID‐19 pandemic, chemosensory dysfunction are among the most prevalent symptoms. Most reports are subjective evaluations, which have been suggested to be unreliable. The objective is to test chemosensory dysfunction and recovery based on extensive psychophysical tests in COVID‐19 during the course of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study Design\n",
    "Prospective cohort study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "A total of 111 patients from four centers participated in the study. All tested positive for SARS‐COV‐2 with RT‐PCR. They were tested within 3 days of diagnosis and 28 to 169 days after infection. Testing included extensive olfactory testing with the Sniffin' Sticks test for threshold, discrimination and identification abilities, and with the Taste Sprays and Taste Strips for gustatory function for quasi‐threshold and taste identification abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection. During infection 21% were anosmic, 49% hyposmic, and 30% normosmic. After infection only 1% were anosmic, 26% hyposmic, and 73% normosmic. For gustatory function, there was a difference for all taste qualities, but significantly in sour, bitter, and total score. Twenty‐six percent had gustatory dysfunction during infection and 6.5% had gustatory dysfunction after infection. Combining all tests 22% had combined olfactory and gustatory dysfunction during infection. After infection no patients had combined dysfunction.\n",

    "Conclusions\n",
    "Chemosensory dysfunction is very common in COVID‐19, either as isolated smell or taste dysfunction or a combined dysfunction. Most people regain their chemosensory function within the first 28 days, but a quarter of the patients show persisting dysfunction, which should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for rehabilitation of chemosensory function.\n",

    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic in 2020 made olfactory and gustatory dysfunction known to everyone, although olfactory dysfunction is common in the general population.1-3 Apart from aging and chronic rhinosinusitis one of the most frequent causes is post‐infectious (post‐viral) olfactory dysfunction with frequency rates of 31% to 39% of patients presenting at specialized smell and taste clinics.4, 5 Gustatory dysfunction is much less prevalent with a rate up to 5%.6 This all changed dramatically in early 2020 with the COVID‐19 pandemic, as smell and taste dysfunction are among the most common symptoms of the disease—even in absence of other symptoms. Reported frequencies range from 0% to 98%.7\n",
    "\n",
    "Most studies are based on subjective findings, and only few studies have tested the dysfunction with psychophysical tests.7-11 These studies mainly used self‐administered tests or short and coarse screening tests of olfactory function.12-14 Previous studies have found self‐ratings of olfactory function unreliable and inaccurate.15, 16 For this reason, to provide us with deeper knowledge into COVID‐19 detailed extensive objective tests are needed to truly access the related chemosensory dysfunction during the infection, but also to learn about recovery rates after infection. For this reason, the aim of this study was to objectively test chemosensory dysfunction in COVID‐19 patients during infection and after the infection with the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory test17 for threshold, discrimination and identification, and the Taste Strips for detailed gustatory testing with quasi‐threshold and identification abilities18—to evaluate olfactory and gustatory function and recovery during the course of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n",
    "Participants\n",
    "A total of 111 real‐time polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) confirmed COVID‐19 patients participated in the study. Inclusion criteria were: >18 years of age and COVID‐19 positive. Exclusion criteria were: Previous sinus or nasal surgery, previously diagnosed neurological or psychiatric disorders, and previously diagnosed olfactory or gustatory dysfunction. They were recruited from four sites in Italy and Germany: Smell and Taste Clinic, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany; Center for Rhinology and Allergology, Wiesbaden, Germany; Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig‐Maximilians University, Munich, Germany; and Department of Otolaryngology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inclusion was during the time from April 2020 to October 2020 and were studied prospectively. The group consisted of 52 females, 59 males. All patients had an RT‐PCR confirmed COVID‐19 infection. The participants had a mean age of 44.5 years (standard deviation 15.0) ranging from 18 to 77 years. None of the patients had previously been diagnosed with olfactory‐ or gustatory dysfunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prospective study was conducted at various sites in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the ethics committee at various sites. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedures\n",
    "Testing of the participants was performed in quiet and well‐ventilated rooms. All participants were told not to eat, drink, smoke, or brush their teeth up to 1 hour before participation in the test, but they could drink water.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sites examined the participants during infection and re‐tested once after the infection. Testing was done within 3 days of diagnosis of COVID‐19. Retesting was performed for the sites at different time points, following the sites usual follow‐up schedule: 28 days after infection (Center of Rhinology and Allergology, Wiesbaden, Germany), 45 days after infection (Department of Otolaryngology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy), 77 to 162 days after infection (Smell and Taste Clinic, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany), and 98 to 165 days after infection (Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig‐Maximilians University, Munich, Germany). The mean days of testing after the infection was 62.9 days (SD 45.8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gustatory Testing\n",
    "Two methods of gustatory testing were used at various study sites, as available on site. A simple testing tool: Taste Sprays and a more detailed tool: Taste Strips. For screening of taste function the Taste Sprays were used.19 The Taste Strips were used at the Department of Otolaryngology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. The Taste Sprays were used at the Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig‐Maximilians University, Munich, Germany and Smell and Taste Clinic, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany. The taste sprays comprises sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste qualities in concentrations above threshold: sucrose (1 g in 10 ml water), citric acid (0.5 g in 10 ml water), sodium chloride (0.75 g in 10 ml water), and quinine hydrochloride (0.005 g in 10 ml water). The different sprays are sprayed in a pseudo‐randomized order on the tongue of the participant. Then a forced‐choice paradigm is used by asking the participant if the spray was sweet, sour, salty, or bitter. The participants could try the sprays up to three times. Gustatory dysfunction was assumed if participants failed to correctly identify two (or more) of the four sprays. If the participants failed to identify only one of the sprays, this was not regarded as dysfunction, due to the common taste quality confusion in the general population.20, 21 The Taste Strips (Burghart Messtechnik, Germany) is a more extensive test of gustatory function.18 The Taste Strips is a gustatory test tool validated for testing identification and quasi‐threshold abilities for the four basic taste qualities of sweet, salty, bitter, and sour. The strips are presented to the participant in a pre‐defined pseudo‐randomized order for four different concentrations of each taste quality.18 This test provides results for gustatory thresholds and identification abilities with a maximum score of 16. A higher score corresponds to a better gustatory function. Cut‐off values used in this study were for hypogeusia a score ≤9 and for normogeusia a score ≥10. No cut‐off values are available for ageusia, as this condition is extremely rare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Olfactory Testing\n",
    "For testing of olfactory function, the present study used two methods for evaluating olfactory function by Sniffin' Sticks (Burghart Messtechnik, Germany), as available on site. The Sniffin' Sticks pens are felt‐tip pens, containing odors as previously described by Hummel et al.22 In the threshold and discrimination subtests participants are presented with three pens in a randomized order. In the identification test the participant identifies the correct odor by a forced multiple‐choice paradigm of four written odor descriptors. For all sub‐tests, a forced multiple‐choice regime was used. The Sniffin' Sticks are presented in front of both nostrils with intervals of at least 30 seconds and approximately 3 seconds per individual pen. Most sites used the Sniffin' Sticks test consisting of three subtests, which provides scores for odor threshold (1–16), discrimination (0–16), and identification (0–16). The three scores are combined to a global olfactory function score consisting of threshold, discrimination and identification combined (TDI‐score: 1–48). All sites except one used the TDI‐test (n = 95). TDI‐score cut‐off value for anosmia (≤16), hyposmia (≤30.5), and normosmia (>30.5) were used.22-24 One site (Head and Neck Surgery, Munich Clinic Schwabing, Academic Teaching Hospital, Ludwig‐Maximilians University, Munich, Germany) used the Sniffin' Sticks 12 Identification set (SIT‐12) (n = 16). For this test the cut‐off values for anosmia (≤6), hyposmia (7 ≤ and ≤ 10), and normosmia (score ≥ 11) were used in the present study.25\n",

    "DISCUSSION\n",
    "The pandemic of SARS‐CoV‐2 has spread to virtually every country in the world. To date, almost 38 million patients have been affected by COVID‐19, and more than one million have lost their lives.26 Various symptoms have been described for the disease, and it has been established (mainly by subjective reports) that smell, and taste is affected by the disease—even mono‐symptomatically. To our knowledge, this is the first study to objectively test chemosensory dysfunction in COVID‐19 patients during infection and after infection with extensive testing of olfactory function for threshold, discrimination, and identification abilities. The prevalence of COVID‐19‐associated olfactory dysfunction ranges in the literature from 0% to 98%.7 Most of these reports are based on subjective ratings of olfactory function where the proportion ranges from 0% to 93%.7 Of note, patients have previously been shown to poorly account subjectively for chemosensory dysfunction—even before COVID‐19.15, 16 This makes it crucial to include psychophysical testing in studies of chemosensory function in relation to COVID‐19. Based on a meta‐analysis, the few objective studies to investigate olfactory function found proportions from 41% to 98%.7 The meta‐analysis of subjective and objective repots of olfactory dysfunction found a combined proportion of 69% (95% CI: 61%–77%).7 This is in line with the current study that found olfactory dysfunction in 72% of patients during infection. We observed that olfactory dysfunction persisted in 27% during our follow‐up period ranging from 28 to 169 days when combining the data from different sites. When only looking at patients re‐tested from day 75 to 169 the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was still 20.5%. This is higher than previously reported by Vaira et al., which only found olfactory dysfunction in 7.2% after 60 days.27 However, it also has to be kept in mind, when assessing results from studies (including this) on hyposmia that hyposmia is frequent in the general population, ranging from 13.3% to 18%.1-3 This might over‐estimate the prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in studies like this, if not taken into account. If we subtract the prevalence from the general population, then the persisting olfactory dysfunction would be closer to 11% in this study, which would be consistent with the finding of 7.2% by Vaira et al.27 However, the patients in the present study is generally younger, and thus the background prevalence is lower, as age is one of the primary indicators of hyposmia in the general population.17 Adding to this, most of the participants noticed a sudden change in olfactory function, which might not have been noticed, were they previously hyposmic or anosmic. All in all this might indicate that the true prevalence could be the one without subtracting the prevalence of hyposmia in the general population, but the point should be taken into account by the reader when interpreting findings of studies of olfactory dysfunction. Most of our participants with persistent dysfunction only had hyposmia, while only a single patient persisted with functional anosmia (which was measured at day 28). Peculiarly, two patients (normosmic during infection) showed hyposmia after infection. None of the other patients exhibited a deteriorating olfactory function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at gustatory dysfunction, most regained their sense of taste, and only four patients still had hypogeusia at follow‐up. No patients had combined gustatory‐ and olfactory dysfunction at follow‐up. It may be speculated that the transient character of taste dysfunction was due to a missing interaction between taste and smell on a central nervous level, which relatively quickly resolved during the course of the disorder.28-30\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the other objective studies mainly used a self‐administered home‐test kit.12, 31 A few studies have used (previously) validated tools for testing olfactory function, but these studies have only applied the Sniffin' Sticks identification set with 12 or 16 odors14, 32—these test kits are commonly meant for the screening of olfactory dysfunction. A major advantage of the present study is the extensive evaluation of olfactory function in terms of threshold, discrimination, and identification abilities. The limitations of the study are that the number of participants for detailed gustatory function is quite limited, however, this is supplemented in the present study with more participants tested with the Taste Sprays. The study had a low dropout of 11 patients olfactory tested with the TDI and six with the SIT‐12. It could be speculated that the participants did not show up for the follow‐up due to the problem no longer being present, however, the patients were not contacted as to why they did not show up. There were 19 participants that were not re‐tested at follow‐up with the Taste Sprays, however, most of these 19 participants (except two) had a normal function at first test. Although the present study only used a single follow‐up for each participant, and it should be interesting to see several follow‐ups, however, as different sites used follow‐up times varying from 28 to 169 days, this does give an overview of the chemosensory function at various timepoints after infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONCLUSION\n",
    "In conclusion, our results seem to indicate that most people with COVID‐associated chemosensory dysfunction regain smell and taste within the first 28 days, which is in line with previous studies. However, up to a quarter of the patients seems to exhibit a longer‐lasting dysfunction—higher than previously expected.27 These patients should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for the rehabilitation of chemosensory function.33\"\"\"\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "The objective of this report is to highlight the possible but little-known association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and delayed onset of central hypocortisolism, which may be of significant clinical importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "We describe a patient who developed new-onset central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of mild COVID-19, which has not been previously reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "A 47-year-old man with recent COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection developed new-onset persistent dyspepsia and eosinophilia for which multiple investigations were normal. He was eventually diagnosed with central hypocortisolism, as evidenced by 8 AM cortisol level of 19 nmol/L (normal, 133-537 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone of 7.1 ng/mL (normal, 10.0-60.0 ng/mL). He was started on hydrocortisone, which led to resolution of both dyspepsia and eosinophilia. At the same time, an interesting thyroid function trend was observed—an initial increase in both free thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone was followed by temporary central hypothyroidism before subsequent spontaneous recovery. On follow-up 3 weeks later, the patient remained hypocortisolemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "COVID-19 may be associated with the delayed onset of central hypocortisolism in its convalescent phase. Although various mechanisms are possible, hypothalamic-pituitary activation during systemic illness, followed by a rebound decrease in activity after recovery, is consistent with the clinical course and thyroid function trend in this patient. It is essential that physicians consider endocrinopathies in the differential diagnosis of such cases, given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crises and their possible contribution to persistent symptoms following recovery from COVID-19.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Hypocortisolism has been reported as a delayed complication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a previous coronavirus pandemic. However, a similar occurrence of hypocortisolism in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is relatively unknown. We report the case of a patient who developed new-onset central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). As far as we are aware, this has not been previously reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Report\n",
    "A 47-year-old man with a known history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (HbA1c 6.4% [46 mmol/mol] in July 2020) was admitted for a right tibial wound that had been treated conservatively. In view of his low-grade fever and anosmia, an oropharyngeal swab was done, which tested positive for SARS coronavirus 2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The diagnosis was COVID-19 URTI; however, no treatment was given; in particular, the patient did not receive any corticosteroids, including dexamethasone. He was discharged to an isolation facility, but he was readmitted 1 week later due to a new-onset seizure.\n",
    "\n",
    "On initial assessment, the patient was afebrile (36.5 °C) with normal blood pressure (118/77 mm Hg), heart rate (96 beats/min), and oxygen saturation (96% on room air). The patient was oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, and there were no signs of meningism or neurologic deficits. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Apart from eosinophilia, blood and cerebrospinal fluid investigations were unremarkable (Table 1).\n",

However, thyroid function spontaneously normalized at 6 weeks after the initial TFT (Table 2). There were no other anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not reveal any pituitary lesions.

    "Discussion\n",
    "There is some published literature on the impact of COVID-19 on established endocrinopathies and vice versa. New-onset hypocortisolism has been reported in a patient with severe COVID-19 who presented with vasopressor-refractory hypotension; however, its etiology was unclear as data on ACTH levels was not available.1 In a retrospective study of 219 patients with severe COVID-19, radiological evidence of acute adrenal infarction was noted in 23% of the patients; among these, 8% had biochemical hypocortisolism2. Several mechanisms have been proposed, including a cytokine storm with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, which leads to decreased ACTH release and impaired function of ACTH and angiotensin-2 on adrenal cells.1,3 A prothrombotic state culminating in disseminated intravascular coagulation has been described, which might be contributed to by direct viral endothelial cell invasion.1,3,4 Other possible mechanisms of hypocortisolism in severe COVID-19 include decreased availability of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol—an essential substrate for cortisol production, decreased cortisol-binding globulin, and increased activity of the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 enzyme responsible for cortisol inactivation.1 However, the development of central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of mild COVID-19 has not been reported previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proposed mechanisms of the central hypocortisolism seen in our patient include both direct and indirect effects of COVID-19. Direct hypophysitis could occur due to viral neuro-invasion from hematogenous spread, retrograde axonal transport, or entry via the angiotensin converting enzyme receptor.5 Strengthening this hypothesis was our patient’s presentation with seizures, which is believed to be due to similar mechanisms.5 This notwithstanding, indirect effects are equally worthy of consideration. An interesting possibility is hypothalamic-pituitary activation with chronic cortisol hypersecretion during systemic illness, followed by a rebound decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary activity after recovery.6 In our patient, the occurrence of this mechanism was supported by his thyroid function trend. In addition, SARS coronavirus infection has been postulated to lead to antibody-mediated destruction of the ACTH through molecular mimicry. As the proteins of SARS coronavirus 2 share 95% to 100% homology with those of SARS coronavirus, similar mechanisms could also be responsible in COVID-19.7\n",
    "\n",
    "We can draw invaluable lessons from a previous coronavirus pandemic, i.e., SARS caused by the SARS coronavirus. In a study of 61 SARS survivors, 39.3% had hypocortisolism, and of these, 83.3% had central hypocortisolism. The onset of hypocortisolism occurred at several weeks post-infection, with 62.5% resolving within one year8. This illustrates 3 important points pertinent to COVID-19. First, there is a significant incidence of hypocortisolism, and thereby, risk of life-threatening adrenal crises. Second, onset is usually in the convalescent phase, as seen in our patient. Third, it is likely that most cases would be transient and would spontaneously resolve; even though this was not observed in our patient, clarification from further studies is awaited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our patient’s TFT trend was intriguing. His initial hyperthyroxinemia (elevation in fT4) and hyperthyrotropinemia (elevation in TSH) could be attributed to hypothalamic-pituitary activation during acute illness.6 With recovery, decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary activity led to a progressive decrease in TSH and, therefore fT4, with temporary central hypothyroidism before subsequent recovery. Indeed, we propose that this is the most likely mechanism that accounts for both central hypocortisolism and thyroid dysfunction in our patient. In the aforementioned study by Leow et al8, 3 patients with SARS developed central hypothyroidism, 2 of whom had concomitant central hypocortisolism; nonetheless, thyroid function spontaneously normalized between 3 to 9 months in all. In both coronavirus infections, a consistent reduction in TSH and T3 has been observed which was correlated with disease severity.9,10 This further strengthens our theory that both viruses act through similar pathophysiologic mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible etiology of thyroid function abnormalities is hypocortisolism itself. As cortisol exerts an inhibitory effect on TSH secretion, hyperthyrotropinemia might be encountered in hypocortisolism, which often normalizes following corticosteroid replacement.11, 12, 13 Hyperthyroxinemia has also been described in hypocortisolism, which is believed to be due to loss of the inhibitory effect of thyroxine on TSH, leading to a state of acquired thyroid hormone resistance.11 However, as both hyperthyroxinemia and hyperthyrotropinemia spontaneously resolved in our patient prior to corticosteroid replacement (Table 2), this explanation is less likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific point to highlight is the possible contribution of hypocortisolism and thyroid dysfunction to persistent symptoms following recovery from COVID-19. The latter is a clinical problem of significant magnitude, yet little is known at present.14,15 In an Italian study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, at 60 days post COVID-19 onset, 87.4% of patients reported persistence of at least 1 symptom, the most common being fatigue, dyspnea, or joint pain.14 Although the etiology of this “post COVID syndrome” is currently unclear, a contributory cause could be underlying endocrinopathy. Indeed, hypocortisolism was proposed to be the cause of similar symptoms in patients recovering from SARS.6,8\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "This report illustrates an important complication of COVID-19: central hypocortisolism, which may have a delayed onset during the convalescent phase of the illness, i.e., at a time when most patients would be expecting to get better. However, little is known about its incidence, natural history, or prognosis. Based on our observations in this case and previous experience with SARS patients, central hypocortisolism post COVID-19 may be transient, although this remains to be determined. In patients recovering from COVID-19, who should be screened, and at what time points? Due to the huge global burden of COVID-19, risk of life-threatening adrenal crises, and contribution to persistent symptoms post-recovery, these are important questions that need to be answered.\"\"\"\n",

    "Neuropsychiatric complications associated with coronavirus disease 2019 caused by the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) are increasingly appreciated. While most studies have focussed on severely affected individuals during acute infection, it remains unclear whether mild COVID-19 results in neurocognitive deficits in young patients. Here, we established a screening approach to detect cognitive deficiencies in post-COVID-19 patients. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 18 mostly young patients 20–105 days (median, 85 days) after recovery from mild to moderate disease who visited our outpatient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. Notably, 14 (78%) patients reported sustained mild cognitive deficits and performed worse in the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status screening test for mild cognitive impairment compared to 10 age-matched healthy controls. While short-term memory, attention and concentration were particularly affected by COVID-19, screening results did not correlate with hospitalization, treatment, viremia or acute inflammation. Additionally, Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status scores did not correlate with depressed mood or fatigue. In two severely affected patients, we excluded structural or other inflammatory causes by magnetic resonance imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. Together, our results demonstrate that sustained sub-clinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults, regardless of clinical course that were unmasked by our diagnostic approach.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 as the cause of a respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (Huang et al., 2020). While patients with COVID-19 frequently suffer from respiratory symptoms, neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications have been increasingly reported (Ellul et al., 2020; Varatharaj et al., 2020). Moreover, histopathologic examination of brains from deceased COVID-19 patients indicate the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) (Solomon et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations include milder symptoms like dizziness and anosmia (Hornuss et al., 2020) but also in rare cases severe manifestations such as acute demyelinating encephalopathy (Reichard et al., 2020), meningitis (Moriguchi et al., 2020) and strokes (Helms et al., 2020; Oxley et al., 2020). Recently, the symptoms of 153 patients with COVID-19 from the UK who reported neurologic and psychiatric complications during the acute phase of the disease were reported and intra-cerebral haemorrhages and altered mental status were the most common complications (Varatharaj et al., 2020). Similarly, in a study from Wuhan with 214 patients, 78 patients reported unspecific neurological symptoms and 13 patients had a new cerebrovascular diagnosis during acute infection (Mao et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "These studies have focussed on severe neurologic and neuropsychiatric complications during the acute infection but did not include sustained neuropsychological deficits after full recovery from COVID-19. Moreover, severe neurologic complications have been mostly investigated in patients with multiple risk factors who developed severe COVID-19 with complications but not in young adults after recovery. For the outbreaks of the closely related SARS-CoV-2 and middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), acute delirium and encephalitis have been reported during acute disease but also sustained neuropsychologic syndromes (Rogers et al., 2020). Thus, deeper analysis and epidemiologic (Ritchie et al., 2020) studies as well as development of screening tools for mild cognitive deficits in young adults are an important unmet clinical need to detect sub-clinical neuropsychologic symptoms and help to differentiate unspecific post-illness-manifestations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we established a facile screening approach for cognitive deficits in 18 young patients without diagnosed cognitive pre-conditions after recovery from COVID-19 and discovered widespread sub-clinical deficits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials and methods\n",
    "Patient cohorts\n",
    "For this cross-sectional study, we randomly interviewed patients from the outpatient clinic of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) and included only the patients who did not stay at intensive care unit. In total, 21 patients were approached and 18 agreed to participate in our study. The severity of COVID-19 into mild, moderate, severe, critical and lethal disease courses was classified using the WHO criteria (WHO reference number: 451 WHO/2019-nCoV/clinical/2020.5). We included only the patients who suffered from mild and moderate COVID-19 and were not admitted to our intensive care unit. Since our patient cohort was considerably younger (mean age, 42.2 years; SD 14.3 years), we additionally tested healthy individuals with similar age (mean age, 38.4 years; SD 14.4 years). Randomly selected healthy individuals were the employees of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, who did not have prior knowledge of the Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS-M) or similar neuropsychological screenings and were matched for age within a range of 5 years but not for sex. Except for one patient who still visited high school, all patients and healthy participants received in total more than 12 years of education. The patient-reported symptoms were collected by individual reports and documented symptoms during the inpatient and subsequent outpatient stays at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. During the interviews, we questioned the patients in a structured manner that included all organ systems and specifically asked for neuropsychological deficits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment tools\n",
    "The interviews were either conducted by phone or directly with the patient. Individuals were recruited until 14 July 2020. To sensitively screen for mild cognitive deficiencies, we utilized the TICS-M that was originally developed to broadly screen for mild cognitive impairment in elderly adults (MCI) by telephone. This questionnaire has been validated for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (reference for mean age, 74.9 years;  amnestic mild cognitive impairment, <34) (Cook et al., 2009) and Alzheimer’s dementia (Manly et al., 2011). We performed TICS-M according to the previously published protocols (Cook et al., 2009). The total interview lasted 15–20 min. Four domains are tested by the TICS-M: (i) orientation, (ii) recent memory and delayed memory, (iii) attention and (iv) semantic memory, comprehension and repetition (language/concentration) (De Jager et al., 2003). The TICS-M included the following items: (i) name, (ii) age, (iii) date, (iv) weekday, (v) season, (vi) phone number (each 1 point), (vii) counting backward (2 points), (viii) first, a 10-word list learning exercise and then a delayed (21) recall of that word list (10 points each), (ix) subtractions (5 points); (x–xiii) responsive naming (4 points), (xiv–xv) repetition (2 points), (xvi) current chancellor and (xvii) president of Germany (each 2 points), (xviii) finger tapping (2 points) and (xix, xx) word opposites (2 points). The total score was 50 points. The TICS-M score has been validated to test episodic memory for words, episodic memory for non-verbal information and attention (Crooks et al., 2006). We controlled for possible biases by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale (PHQ-9) and Fatigue Assessment Scale. Two patients with peculiarly low TICS-M scores (Vignette A, 39 points; Vignette B, 31 points) who reported severe restrictions in their everyday life due to their reported COVID-19-associated neuropsychological symptoms underwent further neurologic and neuropsychologic evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuropsychological and neurological assessment\n",
    "Two patients were invited for further neuropsychological and neurological assessment at the outpatient clinic for neuroimmunological diseases at the Department of Neurology of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany. Neurological examination was performed by board-certified neurologists. Further diagnostic measures included analyses of serological parameters, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cranial imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic procedures\n",
    "We used Cobas6800 system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal smears by polymerase chain reaction as previously described in detail (Pfefferle et al., 2020). For serology, we used Liaison XL system for quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis\n",
    "Data were analysed within the R environment (Version 1.2.5.002) on a Mac OS X. Unless stated otherwise, comparisons between two experimental groups are presented as violin plot with median or 95% confidence intervals and differences were determined using two-tailed, unpaired Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test and were false-discovery rate (FDR)-corrected for multiple comparisons. To find the predictors of screening results, we used multiple linear regression models. The results were FDR-corrected for multiple comparisons. Exact P-values are reported in respective sections of the article and figure legends. We analysed the scores of Fatigue Assessment Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Depression Scale as well as age, length of hospitalization, sickness duration, time from recovery to neurocognitive assessment, maximal PCR cycle threshold values, maximal antibody titres, maximal CRP, IL-6, ferritin and D-dimers as predictors. The outcome variable was the TICS-M score. For effect size of non-parametric comparisons, we calculated Rosenthals r. Significant results are indicated by *P  <  0.05, **P  <  0.01 and ***P  <  0.001.\n",

    "Results\n",
    "The aim of this study was to establish a screening that sensitively and specifically detects subtle neurocognitive deficits. Therefore, we screened our post-COVID-19 outpatient clinic for mostly young patients with mild to moderate disease courses according to the WHO criteria (WHO reference number: 451 WHO/2019-nCoV/clinical/2020.5) without known cognitive pre-conditions who recovered without complications. We included 10 females and 8 males at ages ranging from 17 to 71 years (mean, 42.2 years; SD, 14.3 years). Our cohort consisted of 11 inpatients (61%), 6 outpatients (33%) and 1 patient did not seek medical care (6%). During the acute infection, four patients received supplementary oxygen, two patients were treated with remdesivir and one patient with tocilizumab due to cytokine storm. None of the patients received intensive care and no vascular or structural neurological event was recorded. All patients recovered without severe complications 20–105 days (median, 85 days from COVID-19 recovery to assessment time) prior to the timepoint of our screening (a summary of patients’ characteristics is provided in Table 1). In addition, we tested 10 healthy individuals with similar age (n = 10; mean age, 38.4 years; SD, 14.4 years; a summary of healthy controls’ characteristics is provided in Table 1) as control group.\n",

    "We chose the TICS-M as primary tool (Cook et al., 2009) as it has been extensively validated for screening of mild cognitive deficiencies by telephone. This we considered important when conducting larger studies that include affected individuals who might not seek professional health care and stay in home quarantine. Strikingly, post-COVID-19 patients scored significantly lower results in the TICS-M (mean, 38.83; range, 31–46) compared to healthy controls (mean, 45.8; range, 43–50) (Fig. 1A), especially regarding short-term memory, attention and concentration/language tasks (Fig. 1B). Notably, results from screening for depression (Personal Health Questionnaire 9) and for fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) did not show significant correlation with TICS-M scores (Fig. 1C and D). In terms of patients’ self-reported symptoms, out of 18 included individuals 9 (50%) reported attention deficits, 8 (44.4%) concentration deficits, 8 (44.4%) short-term memory deficits, 5 (27.8%) troubles in finding words, 3 (16.7%) fatigue, 2 (11.1%) severe mood swings and 1 (5.6%) sustained lack of energy, phonophobia and incoherent thoughts (Fig. 1E).\n",

    "Next, we aimed to find the predictors of our observed cognitive deficits. First, we analysed patients’ characteristics and found that neither sex (Fig. 2A) nor age (Fig. 2B) could explain the observed differences. Additionally, we investigated whether severity of the acute COVID-19 disease could be an explanation. Therefore, we next analysed whether hospitalization had an impact on post-COVID-19 manifestations. However, we found that TICS-M scores in post-COVID-19 patients did not correlate with the time interval from our interview to recovery (Fig. 2C), length of sickness (Fig. 2D) and length of inpatient stay (Fig. 2E). To further evaluate the impact of disease severity, we correlated the neurocognitive deficits with acute and sustained somatic symptoms (Fig. 2F) and treatments during the acute infection. Our analysis revealed that the number of somatic symptoms did not correlate with the number of sustained self-reported neurocognitive deficits (Fig. 2G) and the results in our screening (Fig. 2H). Moreover, treatments such as oxygen supplementation (Fig. 3A) and drugs such as remdesivir, tocilizumab or antibiotics (Fig. 3B) in acute infection could not predict the observed cognitive impairments. Thus, our data imply that post-COVID-19 neuropsychologic deficits are independent from hospitalization and disease severity.\n",

    "Subsequently, we analysed the impact of acute inflammation and maximal viremia in acute COVID-19 on neurocognitive deficits. Therefore, we accounted the cycle threshold from SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and inflammatory serum markers. Our analysis revealed that maximal SARS-CoV-2 IgG-titres (Fig. 3C), SARS-CoV-2-PCR cycle threshold values (Fig. 3D), CRP (Fig. 3E), ferritin (Fig. 3F), IL-6 (Fig. 3G) and D-dimer (Fig. 3H) serum concentration during acute COVID-19 were not significant predictors of our observed neurocognitive deficits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further diagnostic measures, we investigated the two most severely affected patients by cranial MRI and lumbar puncture that excluded structural pathologies and acute inflammation. Detailed neuropsychologic evaluation confirmed deficits of attention, executive functions and memory (detailed case vignettes are reported in the supplementary material).\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 affects multiple organ systems by infiltrating endothelial cells of blood vessels throughout the whole body (Varga et al., 2020). Thus, a multitude of symptoms and clinical disease courses have been described (Gupta et al., 2020). Here, we focussed on the evaluation of neurocognitive post-COVID-19 manifestations in mostly young adults who recovered from acute uncomplicated COVID-19. This study demonstrates substantial neurocognitive deficits that sustain after recovery and advocate screening routines for cognitive deficits during medical care of post-COVID-19 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cerebrovascular events and altered mental status have been described to be common neuropsychiatric manifestations in acute COVID-19 in a nationwide surveillance study in the UK (Varatharaj et al., 2020). In total, 59% of patients with altered mental status could be assigned to a neuropsychiatric disorder, underlining the diversity of COVID-19-associated manifestations. We screened patients after recovery from COVID-19 and found substantial neurocognitive deficits that sustained after acute infection. Moreover, we detected subtle cognitive deficits that did not restrain most patients in daily life and were only unmasked by our specific screening, including deficits in short-term memory, attention and concentration. Retrospective meta-analysis of SARS and MERS outbreaks has revealed acute and long-term neuropsychological deficits. Similar to our findings, most-common post-illness manifestations included impaired concentration and attention in 19.9% and impaired memory in 18.9% of patients after recovery (Rogers et al., 2020). Therefore, our study represents first indications that warrant broad screenings in post-COVID-19 patients to clarify the diversity of neuropsychological deficits and prevent potential further harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Screening methods for mild cognitive deficits are mostly used in the diagnostics of dementia that were validated in elderly adults (Castanho et al., 2014). Here, we chose TICS-M as it has been validated as a telephone screening method which is important for prospective studies that include patients who did not seek professional medical care during or after COVID-19. However, TICS-M has been validated for the diagnosis of mild amnestic dementia in a patient cohort with an average age of 74.9 years (Cook et al., 2009). Since the average age of our patient cohort (42.1 years) was considerably lower, we additionally tested a healthy control group with similar age as control. Thus, further optimization of a standardized screening tool is needed. Our findings suggest to especially focus the screening on short-term memory, attention and concentration. In contrast to currently available screening tools, validation should include all age groups since we and others (Dinakaran et al., 2020; Nalleballe et al., 2020) observed neurocognitive deficits in young adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-viral-syndromes have been described for multiple viral infections, such as Epstein–Barr–Virus or influenza (Hotchin et al., 1989) and are characterized by severe fatigue (Thomas, 1987). Smartphone-App-based patients’ reports assessing fatigue in COVID-19 (Menni et al., 2020) and histopathological findings of viral infiltrates and diffuse immune cell activation in brains from deceased COVID-19 patients (Polak et al., 2020) may indicate similar clinical presentations. However, systematic analysis with large patient cohorts in different cultural settings and different countries is needed for clarification. To exclude potential biases and classical post-viral-syndromes, we additionally screened for fatigue and depression. Our data indicate that neurocognitive deficits after recovery from COVID-19 are independent from fatigue and mood alterations and therefore might be different from the classical post-viral syndrome (Perrin et al., 2020) but a specific post-COVID-19 manifestation. SARS-CoV-2 might infiltrate the CNS through the nose (Riel et al., 2015) and trigger a reactive immune response in the brain that could alter neuronal signalling. In addition, exposure of human brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 revealed direct infection of neurons with subsequent alterations of intracellular signalling and cell death (Ackermann et al., 2020) that could disturb neuronal connectivity. Notably, TICS-M scores of post-COVID-19 patients did not significantly correlate with the maximal inflammatory response during the acute infection. Studies that investigated chronic fatigue syndrome in rheumatic disorders (Korte and Straub, 2019) and multiple sclerosis (Giovannoni, 2006) found that chronic but not acute dysregulation of the immune metabolism and especially cytokine composition correlated with fatigue and individual suffering. Although serum profiling during acute COVID-19 revealed distinct cytokine profiles that correlated with disease outcome (Lucas et al., 2020), detailed immunological profiling of post-COVID-19 patients is sparse. Our study is limited by the sample size. Therefore, we cannot report representative frequencies of post-COVID-19 manifestations and longitudinal monitoring and analysis of large cohorts of post-COVID-19 patients is warranted to find clear correlates with long-lasting symptoms after recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we used the TICS-M that was originally developed to screen for MCI in elderly adults because we aimed to establish a tool that was validated for telephone interviews. However, our test results should be validated by neuropsychological tests that were established in young adults such as the Cambridge Automated Test Battery (Crooks et al., 2006). Furthermore, confounders for cognitive testing such as years of education and substance abuse were not assessed. However, we documented the patients’ profession and except for one participant who still visited high school all patients received at least 12 years of education. Moreover, only two patients received detailed neuropsychological and neurological assessment that confirmed the results of our screening as well as cranial MRI and lumbar puncture to exclude other potential pathologies. However, we provide a clear description of the observed deficits and provide distinct symptoms that will instruct prospective screenings in larger cohorts to sensitively identify post-COVID-19 patients with cognitive deficits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, the results of our study demonstrate that young patients who recovered from uncomplicated COVID-19 can have sustained neuropsychologic deficits that can be unmasked by targeted screening.\n",

    "This study sought to explore the spectrum of cardiac abnormalities in student athletes who returned to university campus in July 2020 with uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n",
    "\n",
    "Background\n",
    "There is limited information on cardiovascular involvement in young individuals with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Screening echocardiograms were performed in 54 consecutive student athletes (mean age 19 years; 85% male) who had positive results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nasal swab testing of the upper respiratory tract or immunoglobulin G antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2. Sequential cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 48 (89%) subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "A total of 16 (30%) athletes were asymptomatic, whereas 36 (66%) and 2 (4%) athletes reported mild and moderate COVID-19 related symptoms, respectively. For the 48 athletes completing both imaging studies, abnormal findings were identified in 27 (56.3%) individuals. This included 19 (39.5%) athletes with pericardial late enhancements with associated pericardial effusion. Of the individuals with pericardial enhancements, 6 (12.5%) had reduced global longitudinal strain and/or an increased native T1. One patient showed myocardial enhancement, and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or reduced global longitudinal strain with or without increased native T1 values was also identified in an additional 7 (14.6%) individuals. Native T2 findings were normal in all subjects, and no specific imaging features of myocardial inflammation were identified. Hierarchical clustering of left ventricular regional strain identified 3 unique myopericardial phenotypes that showed significant association with the cardiac magnetic resonance findings (p = 0.03).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "More than 1 in 3 previously healthy college athletes recovering from COVID-19 infection showed imaging features of a resolving pericardial inflammation. Although subtle changes in myocardial structure and function were identified, no athlete showed specific imaging features to suggest an ongoing myocarditis. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implications and long-term evolution of these abnormalities in uncomplicated COVID-19.\n",

    "Myocardial injury with an elevated troponin level may occur in 7% to 17% of patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and is present in 22% to 31% of those admitted to the intensive care unit (1, 2, 3). Although the mechanisms of myocardial injury are diverse, the clinical differentiation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)– related myocarditis from other forms of myocardial dysfunction caused by hypoxia, inflammatory storm, or a stress cardiomyopathy– like presentation remains challenging. More recently, imaging studies have found changes in left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) structure and function in COVID-19 that can persist beyond the acute stage into several weeks and months of recovery (4). The immediate and long-term effects of these findings are unknown and warrant immediate scientific scrutiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the infection’s rapid spread throughout the community and the recent upsurge in COVID-19 in younger individuals, there is a potential need to understand the prevalence of any undiagnosed COVID-19–related cardiovascular involvement. Specifically, there is limited information regarding cardiac involvement among student athletes with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection (5). This may be relevant for young college students and athletes who may be at a higher risk for sports- and exercise-related arrhythmias and cardiac dysfunction in the presence of underlying COVID-19– related myocardial injury. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate and determine the range of cardiac abnormalities seen in young athletes who had a diagnosis of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 infection after returning to their college campus in July 2020. Using comprehensive echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, we further investigated whether the pattern of echocardiographic involvement, including strain, could be associated with the COVID-19–related cardiac involvement observed on CMR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "This cross-sectional observational study analyzed the data collected from college student athletes who returned to the West Virginia University, Morgantown (West Virginia) campus for the fall 2020 semester and were found to have COVID-19. A total of 160 athletes were tested between June 12 and August 4, 2020 (Figure 1). Initially, screening for COVID-19 by serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody and nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on all athletes. IgG antibody testing was performed using a high-throughput chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay with an ARCHITECT i2000SR immunoassay analyzer (Abbott, Abbott Park, Illinois) (6). The Sports Medicine Team at West Virginia University installed a monitoring protocol for the athletes that used a smartphone-developed application for recognizing COVID-19–related symptoms as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (7). This questionnaire included the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, new onset of anosmia, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In addition, athletes who initially tested negative were retested on a weekly basis by nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. Troponin-I was added to the panel of screening tests on all COVID-19–positive athletes, and additional tests such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and B-type natriuretic protein were evaluated as needed during individualized clinical assessments.\n",

    "Following an appropriate quarantine period, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and comprehensive echocardiography were recommended in all patients; 54 underwent the tests. In addition, all patients who had symptomatic COVID-19 (n = 38) (Figure 1), and any asymptomatic (n = 16) patient with an abnormal ECG or an abnormal echocardiogram (i.e., abnormal global longitudinal strain [GLS] <16% or LV ejection fraction [EF] <50% or diagnostic uncertainty with echocardiographic features of RV dilation and/or RV dysfunction) underwent CMR imaging. We received exemption status from the Institutional Review Board of the West Virginia School of Medicine and followed guidelines issued by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Regulations, with all information collected from the electronic medical records after the patient’s visit. Our research was performed within the ethical guidelines by the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975 (8).\n",
    "\n",
    "Echocardiography\n",
    "Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic examinations were performed using GE Vivid E9 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois) or Philips Epiq 7 (Philips, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) imaging systems equipped with 2.5-MHz and nonimaging transducers. Standard views were acquired, and right and left cardiac chamber quantification was performed according to the American Society of Echocardiography guidelines (9,10). The cutoff values for LV dysfunction (<50%) and RV dysfunction (RV fractional shortening <35%) were based on recommended guidelines (11,12).\n",
    "\n",
    "Speckle tracking echocardiography\n",
    "Speckle tracking analysis was performed in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations by using off-line vendor-free software (ImageArena, TomTec, Inc., Hamden, Connecticut). Longitudinal strain was measured in all 3 views: apical 4-, 3-, and 2-chamber views. The peak GLS and regional longitudinal systolic strain were described using the 16-segment model. For LV GLS, an absolute magnitude lower than 16% was considered abnormal (12). The free wall of the right ventricle was separated into 3 segments, which included the basal, middle, and apical regions. The strain value was calculated as the mean of the strain values present in the 3 segments, and an absolute value lower than 20% was considered abnormal (9,13).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n",
    "CMR was acquired on a 1.5-T magnet (Magnetom Aera, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany). Conventional sequences were obtained for imaging of cardiothoracic anatomy with axial stack of black blood using fast spin echo. Imaging for cardiac function, mass, and volume was performed using balanced steady-state free precession (B-SSFP) cine imaging. Tissue characterization of the left ventricle was performed with edema imaging, T1 mapping, T2 mapping, and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging. Edema imaging was performed using T2-weighted dark blood short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. The acquired T1 mapping was performed using the Shortened Modified Look Lockers Inversion (ShMOLLI) recovery sequence pre-contrast on 3 short-axis slices at the base, middle, and apical left ventricle, the same location as STIR images. T2 map was performed using B-SSFP imaging with 3 different T2 preparation times at the same locations as STIR images and T1 maps (14). Late gadolinium imaging was performed 8 to 12 min after administration of the contrast agent (0.1 mmol/kg of gadobutrol [Gadavist], Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, New Jersey) (15).\n",
    "\n",
    "CMR image analysis\n",
    "Image analysis for LV volumes and function was performed using Vitrea software (Vital Images Inc., Minnetonka, Minnesota). Analysis of the short-axis images of T1 map, T2 map, and T2-weighted images was performed as detailed here. T2-weighted images were visually assessed for hyperintense areas. Analysis was performed to diagnose edema when the myocardial T2 signal intensity ratio was ≥2:1 compared with that of skeletal muscle. Motion-corrected native T1 images were post-processed using Vitrea software. To assess diffuse disease, a region of interest was drawn in the septum at the midcavity or basal cavity (if midcavity images were technically inadequate) in a short-axis image of the left ventricle in all patients for myocardial T1 assessments (16). A previously published native T2 value of more than 52 ms was considered abnormal (17). The estimated normal reference range and cutoff values for normal native T1 were determined by using an age-matched group of 16 healthy individuals (Supplemental Table 1). On the basis of these data, a T1 value of ≥990 ms was considered abnormal. Previous studies have suggested that the native T1 values in age-matched healthy control subjects are slightly higher than in athletes (18), and therefore any values higher than those obtained in age-matched healthy control subjects can be considered abnormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the foregoing, parametric maps and segmental native T1 relaxation times for the 16 myocardial segments were obtained by post-processing the 3 short-axis slices to assess regional disease (cvi42, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, Calgary, Canada). Care was taken to avoid blood pool contamination when contouring the epicardial and endocardial borders. For T2 mapping, the endocardium and epicardial contouring was performed for the basal and midventricular short-axis slices. The apical slice was disregarded, and segments with artifacts were also excluded. NativeT2 relaxation time per segment was quantitated on the motion-corrected images by using cvi42 software (Circle Cardiovascular Imaging). Imaging for myocardial scar and pericardial involvement was performed using a LGE technique at the same location as cine images. Late enhancement was qualitatively assessed visually. Pericardial enhancement was considered if there was involvement of the pericardial layers and was confirmed by 2 observers. T1 map and B-SSFP cine images were used to differentiate fat tissue carefully from pericardial enhancement (Videos 1, 2 and 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrated multimodality adjudication of abnormalities\n",
    "CMR features specific to myocardial inflammation required the presence of at least 1 T2 criterion (global or regional increase of myocardial T2 relaxation time or an increased signal intensity in T2-weighted CMR images) and 1 T1 criterion (an increased myocardial T1, or LGE) (19). In addition, the abnormalities seen on echocardiography and CMR were integrated and adjudicated as follows: 1) pericardial: defined as the presence of late enhancement with pericardial effusion on CMR; 2) myocardial: presence of any of the following criteria in isolation or in a combination: a) LVEF <50%, b) presence of regional wall motion abnormality, c) GLS <16%, and d) native T1 increase ≥990 ms; and 3) myopericardial: a combination of items 1 and 2.\n",

    "Statistical analysis\n",
    "As a first step, we performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to check whether the data were normally distributed across different groups. We found that most of the variables were not normally distributed; therefore, we used nonparametric methods for all statistical analyses. Continuous data were expressed as the median (interquartile range). Categorical data were presented as counts (percentages). Comparisons of continuous variables of demographics, echocardiography, and CMR among different groups (i.e., control subjects, symptomatic COVID-19–positive student athletes, and asymptomatic COVID-19–positive student athletes) were performed using either the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn-Bonferroni correction or the Mann-Whitney U test. A chi-square test was used for categorical variables with an expected value for each cell to be 5 or greater. If this assumption was not met, a Fisher exact test was used. To investigate the relationship between regional strain and CMR, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify relationships among the 16 segmental longitudinal strains that could otherwise remain undiscovered (additional details are presented in Supplemental Methods section). All statistical analyses were performed using Medcalc for Windows version 19.5.2 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) and RStudio version 3.1.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Statistical significance <0.05 was used for all tests.\n",

    "Results\n",
    "A total of 160 student athletes were screened for COVID-19;53 (33.1%) tested positive on PCR, whereas 7 (4.3%) athletes tested positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). A total of 4 (2.5%) individuals had positive results on both PCR and IgG antibody tests. By August 9, 2020, a total of 54 college-level athletes with COVID-19 had undergone imaging studies (Table 1). The median time interval from tests performed to the imaging assessment was 27 days (range 22 to 33 days). Overall, the median age was 19 years (range: 19 to 21 years), and more than 85% of the cohort was male. A total 36 (66%) and 2 (4%) individuals experienced mild and moderate COVID-19–related symptoms, respectively; however, the illness was self-limited, and none of the participants required hospitalization (20). The remaining 16 (30%) athletes reported no symptoms at the time of COVID-19 screening.\n",

    "Nearly one-fourth of the symptomatic COVID-19 patients also experienced cardiac symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, or lightheadedness), whereas only 1 (6%) of the patients with no specific COVID-19 symptoms, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline (7), subsequently reported a single episode of chest pain during the quarantine period.

However, despite the significant group differences, these values are mostly within normal range for athletes and the general population. One symptomatic patient had an EF <50% with global hypokinesis (11). A total of 4 (11%) and 2 (13%) patients from the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively, had reduced GLS. There were no significant differences in the GLS or RV strain (Table 2). Small pericardial effusions (≥5 mm) were detected in 3 individuals. The importance of the described echocardiographic findings in student athletes with COVID-19 is underlined by the comparison of age-matched athletic control subjects (n = 20) showing normal findings of LV structure and function in otherwise healthy noninfected athletes (Table 2).\n",

    "In the heatmap, the rows represent the different segmental strains, and the columns correspond to the patients. Euclidean measure for distance matrix and complete agglomeration method were applied to generate the cluster dendrograms on the top and the left of the heatmap. A red-blue color representation is used in presenting the relative intensity decrease in segmental strains across patients. The top row identifies the presence of abnormal global longitudinal strain (GLS) (<16, black boxes) from echocardiography. The second row identifies the category of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) abnormalities as shown in legend. ant = anterior; bas = basal; EF = ejection fraction; inf = inferior; LGEmyo = late gadolinium enhancement involving myocardium; LGEperi = late gadolinium enhancement involving pericardium; seg-LS = segmental longitudinal strain; sept = septal; T1 = native T1.\n",

    "Discussion\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use comprehensive echocardiography with speckle tracking strain and CMR to explore the spectrum of cardiac involvement in college student athletes who recovered from uncomplicated COVID-19. Abnormal findings on cardiac imaging were seen in more than one-half of the patients, with 39.5% having pericardial late enhancement with pockets of pericardial effusion and patchy or a diffuse pattern of myocardial segmental strain abnormalities. Although the immediate and long-term clinical relevance of these findings remains unclear, our study underscores that mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 is not a benign illness, considering that more than one-half of the younger individuals showed subclinical myocardial and pericardial disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent CMR studies performed in adults convalescing from COVID-19 indicated a high prevalence of myocardial inflammation (1,4). In a recent study of 26 competitive athletes with COVID-19 that included 12 with mild symptoms and 14 asymptomatic athletes, CMR findings consistent with myocarditis on the basis of the presence of myocardial edema by elevated T2 signal and myocardial injury shown by the presence of nonischemic delayed enhancements were reported in 4 (15%) athletes (5). In contrast, we observed a high prevalence of late pericardial enhancement. The normal pericardium is avascular, and hence gadolinium uptake indicates signs of increased vascularity with pericardial inflammation. However, in our cohort, none of the patients had classic signs of acute inflammation (edema on CMR T2 imaging or elevation of inflammatory biomarkers). Patients frequently showed residual pockets of pericardial effusion, a finding suggesting that this may represent a subacute or convalescing phase of pericarditis. It remains unclear whether the pericardial involvement seen in our study represents a primary viral involvement or identifies a more generalized COVID-19–related multisystemic inflammatory syndrome (21). During CMR imaging, we did not note additional involvement of serous surfaces such as the lung pleura in our cases. Interestingly, endothelial injury associated with intracellular SARS-CoV-2 has been described to cause new vessel growth, a unique mechanism referred to as intussusceptive angiogenesis (22). A potential susceptibility of pericardial mesothelial cells to SARS-CoV2 virus secondary to increased angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor activity coupled with inflammation and angiogenesis could explain the high prevalence of pericardial late enhancements and requires investigation (23).\n",
    "\n",
    "COVID-19 can disrupt the cardiac contractile machinery and can cause unique patterns of LV segmental dysfunction (24, 25, 26, 27). Although the significance of these abnormalities is currently unclear, it is important for us to understand whether multimodality imaging can be used to identify clusters or subgroups of different pathophysiological phenotypes of COVID-19–induced cardiac involvement. Recent studies have used speckle tracking echocardiography–derived GLS with CMR for diagnosing the extent of myocardial dysfunction in viral myocarditis (28, 29, 30). Using similar multimodality imaging along with hierarchical clustering, an approach used previously to risk stratify COVID-19 patients (18), we identified 3 distinct phenotypic clusters in student athletes (Figure 6). However, the presence of a mere reduction in myocardial strain or an increase in native T1 does not imply myocarditis because similar findings may result from inflammatory or takotsubo cardiomyopathy–like stress-induced myocardial dysfunction (31). More work is needed to establish the prognostic relevance of these phenotypic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although direct myocardial or pericardial biopsy samples could establish these hypotheses, such investigative steps may be unreasonable for less symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, considering that most patients with isolated CMR pericardial late enhancement would likely experience a benign course (32). A distinct 15% to 30% of patients could be at a risk of recurrent pericarditis or constrictive pericarditis (33). The presence of myocardial inflammation could have more severe consequences because chronic smoldering myocarditis could lead to the development of heart failure (34). In addition, the evidence of isolated nonischemic myocardial LGE on CMR can be a substrate for malignant arrhythmia and severe complications, such as sudden cardiac death (35). Therefore, until we have more information about the true nature of COVID-19–related illness, careful surveillance with cardiac imaging will be of paramount importance for identifying successful resolution or disease progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Study limitations\n",
    "First, although several studies have described delayed myocardial enhancement within the LV myocardium in ostensibly healthy athletes, the conservative estimates suggest that significant cardiac abnormalities are encountered in a frequency of 1:200 (0.5%) (36). The frequency and distribution of abnormalities in this confined group of young symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 athletic students are therefore much higher than incidental findings reported in athletes from this age group. Second, because CMR was not clinically indicated in all asymptomatic athletes with COVID-19, this could bias our observations on the true prevalence of subclinical findings in asymptomatic COVID-19. Third, although no subepicardial involvement was identified in LGE, the visceral pericardium is in extreme proximity, and a direct extension (less than a few pixels involvement) into the epicardium cannot be resolved. Fourth, although we used a multiple-step process to differentiate fat carefully from pericardial enhancements by using T1 maps and B-SSFP cine images with confirmation offered by a second reader, a step using fat-saturated LGE could improve further confirmation of pericardial enhancement. Fifth, for COVID-19–related myopericardial involvement, we are unable to compare the direct prevalence estimate with other forms of viral infection. For example, PCR-confirmed H1N1 influenza can cause a high frequency of myocardial involvement in nearly one-third of patients (37). However, the prevalence and pathobiology of tissue inflammation are likely different in COVID-19 and influenza (22). Sixth, distinguishing an athlete’s heart from myocardial disease is a conundrum pertinent to the present study. Although athletes can present with low-normal values for EF and preserved GLS (11), elevation of native T1 or pericardial enhancements is not a routine feature of physiological adaptation. A recent study of 30 athletes reported marginally reduced native T1 values in comparison with age-matched healthy control subjects (38). Similarly, although minimal pericardial effusions can be seen in athletes, these are not accompanied by features of late pericardial enhancement (39). Further testing with calculation of extracellular volume could be helpful. The lack of uniformly in collected hematocrit in all patients precluded us from estimating the extracellular volume from CMR T1 mapping. The lack of CMR studies from a control athletic group makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the magnitude of CMR findings in athletic students with COVID-19. Finally, detailed clinical follow-up with imaging was unavailable for these patients at the time of the analysis. We used a plan for individualized assessments and the protocol for returning to play as outlined in the Supplemental Results section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "In a young, otherwise healthy cohort of college athletes recovering from COVID-19, myocardial and pericardial abnormalities were frequently identified using echocardiography and CMR. The presence of abnormal GLS and regional longitudinal strain identified the varying phenotypic patterns of myocardial involvement with a varying degree of regional myocardial dysfunction. These data will help in developing future cardiac screening strategies and will guide serial testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID-19.\n",
    "Perspectives\n",
    "COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Previously healthy college athletes recovering from COVID-19 have a high prevalence of CMR imaging findings that suggest resolving pericardial inflammation. CMR T1 mapping and speckle tracking echocardiography also revealed subtle changes in myocardial structure and function.\n",
    "\n",
    "TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Although specific clinical features of ongoing myocardial inflammation were not frequently identified, future studies are needed to address the underlying pathophysiological process and long-term evolution of the myopericardial abnormalities seen in uncomplicated COVID-19.\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "Objective: The aim of this study was to observe the liver function recovery of COVID-19 patients after\n",
    "discharge.\n",
    "Patients and Methods: A total of 253 discharged COVID-19 patients in Shenzhen city, China were selected.\n",
    "The clinical characteristics of these patients were assessed. A 2-month follow-up and laboratory hematology\n",
    "test were performed to examine the status of patients’ liver function.\n",
    "Results: Patients combined with liver diseases, especially fatty liver, are more likely to progress to severe\n",
    "condition (P<0.05). Patients in severe condition and those with liver diseases have higher rates of liver injuries\n",
    "during hospitalization, characterized by a significant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate\n",
    "aminotransferase (AST, P<0.01). The ALT, AST/ALT, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase\n",
    "(ALP), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), and A/G levels showed significant differences in comparison with the\n",
    "control group (P<0.05, and P<0.001); and the outlier ratio of A/G, ALT, GGT and ALP of patients remained\n",
    "abnormal higher within 14 days after discharge (P<0.001). Liver injuries of COVID-19 patients may be related\n",
    "to the epidemiological characteristics, clinical indexes, basic diseases, symptoms, drug treatment during\n",
    "hospitalization and the complications. Indicators of liver function were correlated with cardiac function, renal\n",
    "function, thyroid function, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, immune index, leukocyte, erythrocyte,\n",
    "hemoglobin and platelet related indexes. The outlier ratio of TP, ALB and GLB remained extremely low\n",
    "throughout the follow-up period; the outlier ratio of ALT, AST and GGT decreased below 10% from a high\n",
    "level at 40 days after discharged. However, the outlier ratio of A/G, AST/ALT and ALP remained high during the\n",
    "follow-up period.\n",
    "Conclusions: Abnormal liver function might indicate worse recovery of COVID-19 patients. Changes in liver\n",
    "function should be emphasized during long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge; the\n",
    "necessity of employing appropriate interventions for liver function repair should be emphasized.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 has been a\n",
    "significant public health threat over the past few\n",
    "months [1]. Worldwide, the number of laboratoryconfirmed patients infected with COVID-19 at the end\n",
    "of October 12 2020 was over 37 million and more than\n",
    "1 million patients died. The overall case fatality rate\n",
    "exceeded 5%, and the rates are higher in older\n",
    "patients, men, and those with basic disease [2-4]. The\n",
    "virus has been shown to affect multiple organs and\n",
    "systems, such as the heart, kidneys, liver, nervous\n",
    "system and blood system [5, 6], however, the impacts\n",
    "on the reproductive system and whether there is\n",
    "vertical transmission between mother and child is still\n",
    "controversial [7]. Patients with diabetes, hypertension,\n",

    "or even dying once infected. Besides, they have to\n",
    "weigh risk and benefit of giving treatment vs chances\n",
    "of getting infected, especially for cancer patients [8].\n",
    "Recently, COVID-19 patients with liver diseases\n",
    "during hospitalization have received particular\n",
    "attention, based on the experience from the previous\n",
    "SARS epidemic [9]. Previous studies indicated that\n",
    "2%–11% patients with COVID-19 had underlying\n",

    "liver derangement such as chronic hepatitis B or\n",
    "hepatitis C, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver\n",
    "cirrhosis, and liver transplantation might be variable\n",
    "in different clinical scenarios, and proper\n",
    "management should be provided to COVID-19\n",
    "patients with liver diseases [11].\n",
    "About 60% of patients infected with SARS have\n",
    "been reported with liver impairments. In the current\n",
    "COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of liver injury\n",
    "and associated clinical characteristics are not welldefined. Deaths due to liver damage have been\n",

    "COVID-19 in those with liver diseases and liver\n",
    "injuries are worse, resulting in the impending global\n",

    "mainly characterized by acute increase in the ALT and\n",
    "AST levels during hospitalization[14]; however, the\n",
    "possible mechanisms are still unclear and might be\n",

    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus), was initially called an outbreak and, in a short period of time, turned out to be the first pandemic from a coronavirus.1 Experts believe that the actual numbers of those infected are probably much higher than the reported confirmed numbers, as most cases of the disease are not diagnosed: not only because many patients have a subclinical or mild form of the disease and will not get medical attention, but also due to the limited diagnostic resources in many countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last couple of months, the clinical and imaging features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been discussed in numerous publications, and the major imaging findings of the disease have been described in detail. However, the postrecovery course of the disease, including its physical and psychological sequela, is not yet clear.2,3 The long-term effect of COVID-19 on lung parenchyma and pulmonary function remains an outstanding question. Although it is too early to completely answer this question, our limited observations demonstrate significant pulmonary sequela of the disease in some of the survivors (Fig. 1).\n",

    "FIGURE 1\n",
    "FIGURE 1: A 56-year-old man presented with shortness of breath and fever for a few days. Chest CT at the time of admission (day 1) demonstrated bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities (A) suggestive of COVID-19, a diagnosis which was subsequently confirmed by RT-PCR. On day 11 of admission, the ground-glass opacities were near completely replaced by airspace consolidations (B). Follow-up imaging after the discharge (35 d after the initial CT) demonstrates residual parenchymal consolidations with suggestion of fibrotic bands (C, D).\n",
    "In general, survivors of viral pneumonias are at risk of psychological and physical complications of the disease itself, as well as treatment-related lung damage and other organ injuries.4 Long-term lung disability is not uncommon in patients who have recovered from severe viral pneumonias. Although most survivors can return to work and normal life, a significant number of them will show residual ventilation and blood-gas diffusion abnormalities.4\n",

    "LESSONS FROM SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) AND INFLUENZA\n",
    "One of the most important studies in the field, conducted by Zhang et al,5 is a comprehensive 15-year follow-up on health care workers who survived nosocomial SARS infections in 2003. In 27 recovered patients who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) from 2003 to 2018, the extent of pulmonary injury gradually decreased, but the findings were not completely resolved. The evolution and healing of the pulmonary disease were most prominent within the first year after recovery and remained stable afterward until 2018. Among those patients whose postrecovery CT scans showed no abnormalities in 2003, the pulmonary function in 2018 was better than that of 2006. These findings indicate that, even in patients with early complete resolution of chest CT abnormalities, pulmonary function took several years to return to normal. Moreover, 15 years after the initial infection, the forced expiratory flow 25% to 75% value and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC ratio) were significantly reduced in patients with residual chest CT abnormalities compared with those with complete radiologic recovery. The authors suggested a correlation between chest CT findings and pulmonary functional changes with prognostic implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wu et al6 reported follow-up high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of 11 patients at 3, 6, and 84 months postdischarge of inpatient treatment for SARS. The average number of involved lung segments decreased from 10 segments per patient at 3 months to 9.6 segments at 6 months and 6.8 segments at 84 months. At 3 months, the predominant CT feature of residual lung abnormality was the presence of ground-glass abnormalities, with or without consolidation. At 6 months, the presence of residual ground-glass abnormalities was still the predominant imaging feature, but approximately one-fourth of patients demonstrated reticulation and interlobular thickening. At 84 months, only 1 patient had no lung abnormality, with most of the remaining patients demonstrating only reticulation and interlobular thickening, and ground-glass opacity or traction bronchiectasis was found in only 3 patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chen et al4 performed a 24-month follow-up study on patients with epidemic influenza A (H7N9) virus infection. On the 3-month postrecovery chest CTs, they observed several residual radiologic changes, including linear fibrosis, focal pleural thickening, and small bullous cyst formation. Although these changes showed improvement six months after the hospital discharge, no marked changes were noted after six months, suggesting that some pulmonary changes during the 6-month convalescence period can be irreversible. At the 12-month follow-up imaging, they reported that only 14.6% of patients demonstrated normal chest CTs, while residual parenchymal ground-glass opacities and reticular patterns, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, pneumatocele, pulmonary nodules, and small bullous cysts were identified in 51.2%, 41.5%, 24.4%, 22.0%, 9.8%, 9.8%, and 4.9% of patients, respectively. From a physiological point of view, both ventilation and diffusion pulmonary dysfunction persisted, but decreased throughout the follow-up of these patients. The ventilation dysfunction decreased from 78.7% of the patients at the first visit to 55.0% at the 24-month follow-up visit, and the restrictive ventilation dysfunction ratio reduced from 31.9% to 10.0% at the 24-month visit. Most patients also suffered from a residual impairment of diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide, which mild to moderately reduced in severity over time. More importantly, the prevalence of small airway dysfunction and obstructive patterns in survivors tended to increase over time, albeit not significant statistically. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was a poor prognostic factor in terms of long-term pulmonary function. Patients with ARDS consistently achieved lower FEV1, Diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide, and FVC indices over the 24-month follow-up period. This can lead to a lower quality of life in patients who have experienced ARDS, as evaluated by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).\n",
    "\n",
    "In another short-term follow-up study over a period of 3 months performed by Xie et al,7 residual abnormalities were identified on chest radiographs and HRCT of about 20% of SARS patients. Interstitial thickening, residual ground-glass opacities, hypoinflation/volume loss, and bronchiectasis were the main findings. Among the rehabilitating patients with radiographic features of residual lung disease caused by SARS (such as pulmonary fibrotic changes), 55% of patients showed improvement of abnormality on their follow-up HRCT scan in a month.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a study on 5 patients from the first avian influenza A (H7N9) virus outbreak in Shanghai, China, Tang et al8 compared the 6-month postdischarge chest CTs of these patients with their initial CTs obtained during the hospitalization. They found that, despite the resolution of the majority of pulmonary lesions, all survivors demonstrated bilateral residual imaging abnormalities that could be detected in more than 2 lobes. These residual imaging abnormalities were more frequent in bilateral lower lobes with persistent ground-glass opacities observed in all survivors. Interlobular septal thickening, cystic changes, and subpleural linear opacities were among the other common abnormalities. Interestingly, no consolidations or pleural effusions were reported in their study population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lu et al,9 in their 12- and 24-month follow-up study on 2 patients with avian influenza A (H5N1) infection, revealed that the resolution of lung lesions is slow with fibrotic reticular and linear thickening and observed small patchy opacities on CT at the seventh month of follow-up of one patient. Antonio et al10 also found that parenchymal fibrosis starts early in the course of the recovery and tends to be more common in the elderly and more seriously affected patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COVID-19\n",
    "The long-term effect of COVID-19 is still largely unknown. However, based on the previous experiences with other viral pulmonary infections, long-term pulmonary consequences are indeed expected in some patients. As per Xie et al,7 a significant number of patients recovering from the acute viral illness may have significant impairment in overall functional capacity and specifically their pulmonary function in the first few months. More importantly, the radiologic presentation of pulmonary sequela with parenchymal distortion and the physiological damage of pulmonary function may not correlate with clinical symptomatology, and the imaging findings of these viral pneumonias may last for a long time or become permanent.8 The imaging findings correlate with histopathologic features of viral pneumonias, where the lungs histologically show diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, edema, fibrosis, alveolar hemorrhage, type 2 cell hyperplasia, and hyaline tissue formation.11\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing pneumonia and diffuse alveolar damage seem to be, by far, the most common forms of lung injury associated with COVID-19, and both evolve in a fairly predictable manner.2,3,12 Organizing pneumonia has been shown to be the origin of the later changes and complications in a significant number of viral pulmonary infections.13–15 The ground-glass opacities are usually seen during the initial stages of the COVID-19 disease (acute phase of diffuse alveolar damage). Superimposition of consolidation on the existing ground-glass opacities occurs at the progression/complication stage (evolution to organizing phase of diffuse alveolar damage).2 At this point, the pattern of lesions can progress to pure consolidation or may present the melted sugar sign (gradual resolution of consolidation and turning into ground-glass opacities). It may also manifest by the progression of consolidation to band-like opacities (parenchymal bands) in the later stages of the disease and complicate the recovery phase.13,16\n",
    "\n",
    "Different factors may play a role in the severity of residual functional or imaging pulmonary abnormalities and the likelihood of residual scar of the disease. The patient’s age, comorbidities, history of cigarette smoking, length of hospital admission, and the severity of the acute disease (such as the need for ICU admission) and the type of medications administered (such as antiviral or corticosteroid therapy) are probably among the most important determinants.7,10,17 Long-term follow-up chest imaging of survivors is needed for a better understanding of the possible irreversible pulmonary damages of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Meanwhile, follow-up evaluation of recovered patients by a pulmonologist is advised. For any clinical suspicion of residual lung damage, further evaluation by pulmonary function tests and/or imaging may be obtained. In terms of imaging, chest x-ray can be the best initial step. However, in patients with residual radiographic or functional impairment, high-resolution chest CT can be indicated not only for further characterization of anatomic abnormalities of the lung parenchyma but also to establish a baseline for possible future follow-ups.\"\"\"\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "Objective: SARS-CoV-2 infection and its oft-associated illness COVID-19 may lead to neuropsychological deficits, either through direct mechanisms (i.e., neurovirulance) or indirect mechanisms, most notably complications caused by the virus (e.g., stroke) or medical procedures (e.g., intubation). The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be a substantial prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 survivors. To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating PTSD-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of COVID-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods: Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of SARS and MERS patients; neurological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors; PTSD associated with procedures common to COVID-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to PTSD from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions: Heightened risk of PTSD occurred in MERS and SARS survivors. While data concerning COVID-19 is lacking, PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop PTSD in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that PTSD may account for some or all of a patient’s subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance. Recommendations are provided for assessing PTSD in the context of COVID-19.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) leads to coronavirus disease − 2019 (COVID-19) in an unknown percentage of individuals. Considering the ever-growing reports of neurologic complications due to COVID-19, neuropsychologists can expect a substantial number of survivors to present for neuropsychological evaluation in coming months and years. Such evaluations will likely involve questions of disability and be driven by patients’ reports of subjective impairment. While early evidence from COVID-19 case series studies suggests that these survivors may present with a variety of neurocognitive deficits stemming from serious neurologic conditions related to the illness or its treatment, including large vessel stroke, hypoxic brain injury, encephalopathies, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and others (Ashrafi et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020; Paterson et al., 2020), the ability to discern true (objective) from subjective deficits is likely to be complicated by psychiatric comorbidities. Indeed, research from past coronavirus outbreaks, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), indicate a high likelihood of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in COVID-19 survivors, most notably post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Jeong et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2007, 2019; Mak et al., 2009, 2010; Wu et al., 2005). Evidence of the neuropsychological impact of COVID-19 is just beginning to emerge and a full understanding of the long-term side effects of the disease and its treatment may take years to catalogue. Still, as neuropsychologists prepare to evaluate COVID-19 survivors, a discussion of the neurocognitive and psychiatric sequelae of past human coronaviruses, as well as the frequent co-occurrence PTSD and acquired brain injuries, may be instructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neurocognitive sequalae of COVID-19 illness\n",
    "Studies of past human coronaviruses (HCoV) and a steady stream of recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent neuropsychological functioning via direct and indirect routes. Concerning the former, like several other HCoVs (Glass et al., 2004; Li et al., 2016; Talbot et al., 1993), SARS-CoV-2 appears to be both neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. That is, it can breech the blood-brain barrier or gain entry to the CNS via other routes, where its presence can potentially lead to both acute and long-term neurological and neuropsychological sequelae (Arbour et al., 1999; Cristallo et al., 1997; Fazzini et al., 1992; Johnson-Lussenburg & Zheng, 1987; Morfopoulou et al., 2016; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992; Yeh et al., 2004). Among the indirect routes to neurologic and neuropsychological complications posed by the virus is its systemic effects. It is now established that a small minority of COVID-19 patients develop severe neurologic complications, such as infectious toxic encephalopathy, viral encephalitis, and stroke (Asadi-Pooya & Simani, 2020; Wu et al., 2020), perhaps due to the virus’s potential to cause coagulopathy, thrombosis, and inflammation (Mehta et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Neurologic and neuropsychological symptoms may also arise secondary to atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Dreher et al., 2020; Gattinoni et al., 2020). For example, prior research has established that ARDS survivors exhibit deficits in memory, attention, verbal fluency, processing speed, and executive function, with between 30 and 80% of patients continuing to exhibit cognitive impairment a year after ARDS (Herridge et al., 2016; Hopkins et al., 1999; Mikkelsen et al., 2012). Finally, a disproportionate number of severe COVID-19 cases have pre-existing medical conditions that are also associated with neuropsychological deficits, including hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory illness (Ahles & Root, 2018; Bennett & Sauvé, 2003; Janelsins et al., 2018; Novak & Hajjar, 2010; Reijmer et al., 2011; Schou et al., 2012; van den Berg et al., 2010). Therefore, it will be a necessary and difficult task for neuropsychologists to consider complex factors and medical complications experienced by COVID-19 survivors. In short, while the exact nature and scope of the neuropsychological deficits experienced by COVID-19 survivors has yet to be established, outcomes will likely vary widely according to a number of clinical factors and individual differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "PTSD among COVID-19 survivors\n",
    "A careful consideration of the neuropsychological implications associated with COVID-19 must also consider the impact of trauma experienced by survivors. However, little information has been reported regarding potential psychiatric outcomes. PTSD is defined as the development of symptoms related to intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and arousal and reactivity following exposure to a traumatic event (Shalev et al., 2017). Even among those who do not meet full diagnostic criteria, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have also been associated with functional impairment (Westphal et al., 2011; Varela et al., 2011). Based on the information garnered from past human coronavirus outbreaks, specifically SARS and MERS, providers can anticipate an elevated incidence of PTSD and PTSS in COVID-19 survivors. For example, 42% of MERS survivors scored above a clinical cut-off for PTSD one year after the outbreak, with nearly 27% remaining above the cut-off after 18 months (Lee et al., 2019). Similarly, nearly 26% of SARS survivors met full diagnostic criteria for PTSD 30 months after treatment, and all identified SARS infection as their index trauma (Mak et al., 2010). These prevalence rates are far above the population average and suggest that providers should be prepared to evaluate and make recommendations regarding elevated PTSS in COVID-19 survivors. In the current pandemic, several causes of PTSD in the context of COVID-19 can be expected, as discussed next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Near death experience\n",
    "Patients with severe COVID-19 frequently present with respiratory symptoms which may progress to respiratory failure (Xie et al., 2020). Treatment for COVID-19 may involve extreme stressors for patients, including fear of death from life-threatening illness, pain from medical interventions such as endotracheal intubation, limited ability to communicate, and feelings of loss of control (Asimakopoulou & Madianos, 2014; Davydow et al., 2008; Gosselin et al., 2018). One patient described the sensation of COVID-19 respiratory infection as “it feels like you’re drowning…you think you’re going to die” (Buxbaum, 2020), and a respiratory therapist described shock at the severity of pink, frothy secretions occluding patient’s breathing tubes (Presser, 2020). Even patients with moderate illness severity who do not require hospitalization describe fear of death – one patient stated, “I did not go to sleep for three days because I was scared…I wouldn’t wake up” (Brodsky, 2020). These anecdotes illustrate how COVID-19 illness constitutes exposure to threatened death or serious injury, fulfilling the first diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Additionally, given that there is evidence of infection clusters within family units (Qian et al., 2020), survivors may have also experienced trauma related to witnessing severe illness or death of close family members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delirium\n",
    "Another potential cause of PTSD in COVID-19 survivors is delirium. Of particular interest to neuropsychologists, delirium has been investigated as one of the modifiable clinical risk factors for PTSD in patients who receive intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. COVID-19 patients may be at a particularly elevated risk for delirium due to a confluence of the likely neuroinvasive and neurovirulent properties of the virus itself, CNS inflammation in response to other organ system failures, the high percentage of severe COVID-19 patients who are also older adults, and ICU-specific factors such as intubation and ventilation, sedation, and prolonged isolation (Kotfis et al., 2020, O’Hanlon & Inouye, 2020). In elderly and mechanically ventilated populations, delirium may occur in up to 80% of ICU patients (Ely et al., 2004), again suggesting that survivors of severe COVID-19, who are likely to be older adults and require ventilation (Liu et al., 2020), may be at particularly high risk for delirium. Notably, prolonged delirium duration (>40 days) has been associated with higher PTSS (Bashar et al., 2018), but the presence of delirium has not been reliably associated with PTSD post-recovery (Svenningsen et al., 2015; Wolters et al., 2016). Other research has suggested that it is not delirium per say, but the recall of distressing in-ICU delusional memories that contribute to the development of PTSD in ICU survivors (Davydow et al., 2008; DiMartini et al., 2007; Jones et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "ICU-related trauma\n",
    "Post-traumatic stress has been well-documented in survivors of ICU treatment (Cuthbertson et al., 2004; Griffiths et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2019). Invasive ventilation and longer duration of mechanical ventilation in particular have been associated with an increased risk for PTSS (Shaw et al., 2009; Twigg et al., 2008). In Wuhan, China, the earliest epicenter of the outbreak, approximately 3.2% of COVID-19 patients required intubation and invasive ventilation (Meng et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimates of the prevalence of PTSD following ICU stays vary widely, ranging from 0-75%, with median scores falling in the high teens, well above the population prevalence of PTSD (Wade et al., 2013, Jones, 2010, Hatch et al., 2011). Risk of developing PTSD appears to depend on a number of factors including patient characteristics (e.g., age and preexisting comorbidities), and clinical treatment variables (e.g., use of sedation, restraint, and antipsychotic medications; Davydow et al., 2008; Davydow et al., 2009; Girard et al., 2007; Jones, 2010; Wade et al., 2013). Of particular note when considering COVID-19 survivors, some studies have found that patients treated in ICUs for ARDS may have even higher PTSD rates post-treatment as compared to other ICU patients, with higher prevalence of PTSD in ARDS survivors as compared to survivors of general medical ICU and cardiac surgery (Griffiths et al., 2007). PTSS appear to be present in between 30 and 40% of ARDS survivors, even months after treatment (Mikkelsen et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2001; Wade et al., 2013). More generally, estimates of PTSD in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients range from 14 to 51% (Gosselin et al., 2018). Among patients who require mechanical ventilation in the ICU, the most common symptoms include feelings of guilt, mood swings, sleep disturbance, and memories of panic and suffocation (Girard et al., 2007). Thus, as COVID-19 survivors who were treated in ICUs begin to present for neuropsychological evaluation, PTSS should be assessed as a part of a complete evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection between PTSD and neurocognitive functioning in COVID-19\n",
    "Characterizing the cognitive profiles of COVID-19 survivors may be a complex task, as it will be difficult to disentangle the myriad potential etiologies of cognitive dysfunction in this patient population. This task will be further complicated by the possible primacy or comorbidity in a substantial proportion of survivors of PTSD/PTSS which is associated with a range of both subjective cognitive complaints (Mattson et al., 2019; Samuelson et al., 2017) and objective cognitive deficits in domains of verbal memory, sustained attention, and executive function (Aupperle et al., 2012; Brewin et al., 2007; DiGangi et al., 2017; Johnsen & Asbjørnsen, 2008; Malarbi et al., 2017; Polak et al., 2012; Vasterling et al., 2002). Considering the substantial possibility of neurologic symptomology and sequelae among COVID-19 patients, and of PTSD as a primary or secondary diagnostic consideration, understanding how PTSD manifests in other types of acquired brain injury may be instructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survivors of severe COVID-19 are more likely to have a history of hypoxia and resulting acquired brain injury. These have also been associated with both cognitive and psychiatric impairments (Schultz et al., 2018) and progressive brain deterioration more than a decade after the original injury (Tobe, 2012). Both persistent neurocognitive deficits and declining mental health have been observed in ARDS survivors two years after hospital discharge (Hopkins et al., 2005), and cognitive impairment has been associated with worse health-related quality of life and greater disability status in ARDS survivors (Rothenhäusler et al., 2001). Furthermore, 79% of ARDS patients treated in an ICU recalled vivid nightmares and hallucinations (Larson et al., 2007). Other estimates suggest that between one quarter and one half of all ICU patients have limited or no memory of their treatment. In ARDS patients specifically, having no recall of ICU treatment was associated with higher rates of, and more significant, cognitive impairment up to one year after discharge (Larson et al., 2007).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep dysfunction is another complicating factor considering its relationship to PTSD. Poor sleep, typically characterized by wakefulness, a high proportion of time spent in shallow sleep, and a relative low proportion of time spent in REM sleep, is a common complaint among survivors of ICU treatment (Friese et al., 2007; Weinhouse et al., 2009), and sleep problems can persist even after discharge (Dhooria et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2009). Thus, sleep dysfunction can be expected to be seen in a subset of survivors of severe COVID-19 who are treated in the ICU. Decreased sleep quality has also been documented even in non-patients during the COVID-19 lockdowns, associated with stress and anxiety (Marelli et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). Sleep dysfunction commonly occurs in both PTSD, acquired brain injury, and critical illness (Altman et al., 2017; Meeker et al., 2019; Tanev et al., 2014). Importantly, sleep quality may also contribute to cognitive deficits beyond the effects of PTSD (Gilbert et al., 2015), and has been shown to independently negatively impact cognition (Martindale et al., 2017). Poor sleep efficiency after ICU discharge may contribute to post-ICU cognitive impairment (Wilcox et al., 2013). Notably, sleep deprivation in the ICU is a potentially modifiable risk factor for delirium (Litton et al., 2016; Weinhouse et al., 2009), although findings are mixed (Kamdar et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "Delirium, another potential cause of PTSD in COVID-19 patients, is also associated with persistent cognitive impairment and subjective memory decline several years after discharge from the hospital (Bickel et al., 2008). Diagnosis of delirium has also been linked with higher risk of later developing dementia (Jackson et al., 2004; MacLullich et al., 2009; Sprung et al., 2017). This adds an additional level of difficulty for neuropsychologists in attempting to determine the etiology of cognitive impairment in COVID-19 survivors with experienced ICU delirium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration which includes those patients with history of mild or uncomplicated illness is the role of expectation of cognitive effects in survivors of COVID-19. Given the media coverage of neurological involvement in COVID-19 and the yet unknown disease effects on cognition, it is possible that patients may experience iatrogenic effects. The impact of negative illness perception and symptom expectation on cognition has been documented in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), such that negative beliefs about an injury and its effects are independently associated with persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and cognitive deficits (Hou et al., 2012; Mittenberg et al., 1992; Whittaker et al., 2007). Studies of patients with comorbid PTSD and mTBI suggest that subjective cognitive complaints are greater than in patients with mTBI alone (Spencer et al., 2010). Persistent post-concussive symptoms have also been shown to be mediated by the presence of PTSD, suggesting that the experience of PCS such as subjective memory complaints arise from PTSD and not from the mTBI (Pietrzak et al., 2009; Polusny et al., 2011; Porter et al., 2018; Schneiderman et al., 2008). In the context of COVID-19, it may be several years before we are able to disentangle the contribution of PTSD versus brain injury to cognitive functioning, as there may not be clear evidence of brain damage without detailed neuropathological examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations for the neuropsychological assessment of COVID-19 survivors with psychological trauma\n",
    "In the coming months and years, COVID-19 survivors may seek neuropsychological evaluations due to subjective cognitive complaints. A subset of these patients may have been treated in ICUs, been intubated or mechanically ventilated, experienced periods of delirium, or may have experienced direct neurological impacts such as stroke. For these patients, the task for neuropsychologists will be to differentiate whether their cognitive complaints are related to psychological traumatic, premorbid deficits, non-credible effort, neurologic insult, or a combination of the above. As described above, survivors of severe COVID-19 may be more likely to have direct neurological involvement and elevated risk for PTSD/PTSS from their illness and treatment, as compared to those with more mild illness. However, patients who recover from more mild COVID-19 may still be at risk for psychiatric symptoms or negative expectancies that impact cognition, self-report, and perception of disability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be particularly difficult to differentiate the long-term effects of neurologic insult and delirium from PTSD in COVID-19 survivors given that there is currently very little known about the CNS effects of COVID-19 or SARS-Cov-2 infection or what potential neuropathology secondary to the illness exists. Considering the high likelihood of psychological trauma in COVID-19 survivors, it is important that clinicians not attribute subjective cognitive complaints or objective cognitive impairment to acquired brain injury or other medical complications without considering the contribution of PTSD or other psychiatric etiologies. In addition, considering the inevitability of disability claims and perhaps civil lawsuits related to COVID-19, feigned impairment is also likely to be a key consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "While diagnosis of PTSD in COVID-19 survivors may be relatively straightforward, determining the relative contribution of such disorders and COVID-19-related neuropathology to neurocognitive deficits will be challenging. There are no published data on the neuropsychological profiles of survivors of COVID-19, and considering the myriad of indirect causes, a consistent profile is unlikely. Known deficits in attention, executive function, and memory seen in PTSD patients are likely to overlap with the cognitive impairments related to COVID-19. Furthermore, subjective cognitive complaints may be driven more by psychiatric symptoms and expectations rather than actual underlying neuropathology. Additionally, at least in the intermediate-term post-acute phase, individuals who undergo ICU treatment and experience severe medical complications such as respiratory failure or neurologic insult can be fatigued, irritable, anxious, and/or depressed, which also overlap with the non-cognitive clinical symptoms of PTSD (Dolan et al., 2012; Spadaro et al., 2020). Assessment of other specific ICU-related factors which have been linked to cognitive outcomes, such as recall of ICU treatment, experience of delirium, and use of sedatives and analgesics, may be an informative addition to the clinical interview (Jackson et al., 2009). Neuropsychologists must carefully evaluate patients who are at risk of both PTSD and neurologic insult, as is the case with COVID-19 survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the proliferation of media coverage related to COVID-19, including reports of neurological impact, patients may have expectations of poor cognitive performance and persistent neurological symptoms after illness. Clinical experience and empirical research of TBI patients indicates that expectations related to brain injury significantly impact symptom report and neuropsychological test performance (Suhr & Gunstad, 2005; Waldron-Perrine et al., 2015). Subjective cognitive complaints arising in the context of PTSD are likely to persist far longer than cognitive impairments directly resulting from mild brain injury, although patients may attribute symptoms to the acquired brain injury alone (Verfaellie et al., 2014). Trauma-focused psychotherapies, including cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive processing therapy, and prolonged exposure, have been shown to improve cognitive performance (Walter et al., 2010). However, patients who believe that their experienced cognitive symptoms are due to acquired brain injury may have difficulty accepting alternative explanations and the possibility of cognitive recovery following psychotherapy. Neuropsychologists should therefore be prepared that patients with expectancies related to acquired brain injury may be resistant to treatment appropriate for neuropsychiatric conditions (Porter et al., 2018). Normalization of psychiatric symptoms in survivors of ICU treatment may be an important first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be impossible for neuropsychologists to fully disentangle the complex and likely multiple etiologies of cognitive impairment and self-reported cognitive changes in COVID-19 survivors. Given that many survivors of severe COVID-19 will be older adults, these individuals may also have already had premorbid cognitive decline or may be experiencing new cognitive impairment, further complicating the diagnostic picture of these patients. Therefore, while certain recommendations such as cognitive rehabilitation and lifestyle changes may be warranted, referrals for psychotherapy to address PTSS/PTSD may be a valuable additional treatment recommendation. Clinical experience suggests that patients may be amenable to psychotherapy recommendations framed in such a way that suggests that there are multiple routes by which their cognitive symptoms can be addressed simultaneously, increasing the likelihood of improvement of functioning and quality of life. Finally, there will undoubtedly be patients whose cognitive symptoms have no psychiatric cause, but rather result solely from direct or indirect neurological effects of the virus as described above. As research on cognition in survivors of COVID-19 continues to emerge, neuropsychologists must adapt their conceptualizations to follow the evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In sum, evidence from survivors of SARS and MERS, as well as groups similar to survivors of severe COVID-19 (e.g., ARDS patients and other ICU survivors), highlight the need for neuropsychologists to consider either comorbid or stand-alone PTSD in COVID-19 survivors and the consideration that post-traumatic stress may be responsible in part or in full for both subjective cognitive complaints and poor neuropsychological test performance. As evidence of the neurocognitive sequelae of COVID-19 emerges, psychological trauma should not be overlooked as an important contributor to the neuropsychological robustness and quality of life of patients seeking cognitive evaluations. Neuropsychologists working in inpatient settings may be in a position to advocate for follow-ups with patients to reduce likelihood of post-ICU PTSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of objective neuropsychological deficits, the subjective experience of cognitive impairment can also be very emotionally distressing to survivors and clinicians should carefully consider how both brain damage secondary to COVID-19 and secondary to PTSD may be impacting cognition. Neuropsychologists can then provide psychoeducation and treatment referrals appropriately targeted to the patient’s needs to address these subjective cognitive complaints. Inpatient and rehabilitation neuropsychologists may be particularly well situated to recommend PTSS and sleep quality screenings and longitudinal psychiatric and cognitive follow-up. Psychiatric screening follow-up may be particularly important to identify those survivors whose symptoms persist beyond acute stress reactions to potentially meet full diagnostic criteria of PTSD (i.e., greater than one month after the trauma).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, the effects of psychological trauma will not be limited to the survivors themselves; frontline healthcare workers and family members may also experience PTSS and negative effects from stigmatization, as was documented in the SARS and MERS outbreaks (Lee et al., 2019; Maunder, 2004; Park et al., 2018). Neuropsychologists may also play a role in advocating for PTSS screenings and mental health outreach more broadly for frontline healthcare providers, families, and survivors of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\"\"\n",

    "Abstract\n",
    "Background\n",
    "Individuals infected by the novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) have experienced different psychiatric manifestations during the period of infectivity and post‐COVID‐19 infection. Fatigue and anhedonia are among the frequently reported manifestations after recovery from this novel viral pandemic, leading to early evaluation of those patients and proper management of their complaints which have a drastic burden on different domains of life. Also, the period after recovery might have an effect on the severity of these two psychiatric presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim of the work\n",
    "This cross‐sectional observational study aimed to investigate the occurrence of post‐COVID‐19 fatigue and anhedonia and whether the duration after 2 consecutive PCR‐negative tests has an implication on the severity of the above‐mentioned psychiatric manifestations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods\n",
    "Socio‐demographic characteristics of 200 post‐COVID‐19 patients were collected, and also, the self‐assessment anhedonia scale was used to evaluate the degree of anhedonia. Fatigue assessment scale used to investigate this domain. The study targeted to find a possible correlation between the period after recovery and the other variables including anhedonia and fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "The study revealed high scores of different subtypes of self‐assessment anhedonia scale (including total intensity, total frequency, and total changes scores) in the studied group, also high score of fatigue assessment scale in those patients. Positive statistically significant correlation between anhedonia and fatigue in post‐COVID‐19 group, also negative statistically significant correlation between duration after recovery and the other 2 variables(anhedonia and fatigue) in the examined patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Post‐COVID‐19 fatigue and anhedonia were prevalent and commonly reported in the post‐COVID‐19 period, also the duration after 2 consecutive negative PCR tests has an implication on the severity rating scale of both anhedonia and fatigue. These findings directed our attention to those reported manifestations which affected the socio‐occupational functioning of the individuals during this whole world pandemic.\n",

    "1 INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Rothan and Byrareddy1 noted COVID‐19 is a viral infection caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 that principally affects the pulmonology system with primary manifestations like fever, cough, and shortness of breath.\n",
    "\n",
    "World Health Organization2 declared until the end of May 2020, there were over 5.5 million confirmed cases of people who have been infected with COVID‐19 worldwide and over 353 000 death cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Xiang et al9 highlighted infection symptoms including fever, hypoxia and dry cough, shortness of breath, and adverse effects of treatment like corticosteroids induced insomnia might lead to anxiety worsening and mental distress .\n",
    "\n",
    "Rio and Malani3 highlighted that fatigue is commonly seen in COVID‐19 epidemic, and also, the patients still have high levels of fatigue and anhedonia after recovery from infection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treadway and Zald4 defined anhedonia as persistently and severely decreased interest or pleasure in most daily activities. It is also known as a decrement of pleasurable activities, or a loss of interest to action in order to get pleasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brodaty et al5 found that anhedonia and fatigue can also occur in patients without psychiatric disorders like in systemic illnesses ,viral infections, or chronic fatigue syndrome. Similarly, apathy and anhedonia were recognized to occur not only in the context of clinical diagnoses but also, in milder forms, in the general population, particularly with aging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Brooks et al6 noted the effect of quarantine on cases of COVID‐19 infection leading to development of psychological and cognitive manifestations of post‐COVID‐19 depressive symptoms, stress, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and anhedonic state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hives et al7 evidenced pro‐inflammatory components like cytokines such as interferon gamma, and interleukin 7, which supposed to compromise the neurological regulation of the “Glymphatic System” as observed in chronic fatigue syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perrin et al8 found that many cases of COVID‐19 developed a drastic post‐viral syndrome named “post‐COVID‐19 Syndrome”—a persistent condition of chronic fatigue, disturbed sleep/wake cycle, neuro‐cognitive implications, and progressive anhedonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 METHODS\n",
    "2.1 Settings\n",
    "This study was conducted in Hayat National Hospital, Psychiatry Department, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted from 10th of July to 28th of July 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Study design\n",
    "This current methodological design is a cross‐sectional observational study with a longitudinal component for evaluation of prevalence of anhedonia and fatigue in post‐COVID‐19 patients and the effect of duration after recovery from infection on the above‐mentioned domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.3 Study population\n",
    "A convenience sample of 200 patients of COVID‐19 after 2 consecutive negative PCR tests who attended for pulmonology clinic for follow‐up and psychiatric department for assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.4 Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n",
    "All patients of both sexes, with age range from 18‐60 years, can read and write to complete the scales, 2 negative PCR tests for COVID‐19, those have major psychiatric disorders, other general medical conditions like chronic diseases that might be manifested by fatigue or under the effect of psychotropic medications were excluded from the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.5 The self‐assessment anhedonia scale (SAAS)\n",
    "This scale was developed by Olivares et al10 The scale included 27 items each to be replied on three independent semantic differential lines: 1. Intensity (a lot—not at all), 2. Frequency (always—never), and 3. Change (the same as before—less than before). Each line was 10 cm long and could be scored on a Likert‐type scale ranging from 0 to 10. The higher the score, the greater the anhedonia. To avoid halo effects, the second line polarities were reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.6 Fatigue assessment scale(FAS)\n",
    "This scale was originated by Michielsen et al11 The FAS is a 10‐item scale evaluating symptoms of fatigue. Each item of the FAS is answered using a five‐point, Likert‐type scale ranging from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”). Items 4 and 10 are reverse‐scored. Total scores can range from 10, indicating the lowest level of fatigue, to 50, denoting the highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.7 Ethical consideration\n",
    "IRB approval was taken to conduct this study.\n",
    "Informed consent was obtained from all participants after full explanation of the aim of the study.\n",
    "Patients were confirmed about the confidentiality of their data collected and that they were able to withhold from the study at any time without giving reasons.\n",
    "2.8 Statistical analysis\n",
    "Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package of Social Science (SPSS) program for Windows (Standard version 24). The normality of data was first tested with one‐sample Kolmogorov‐Smirnov test. Qualitative data were described using number and percent. Continuous variables were presented as mean (SD) and two groups were compared by t test while ANOVA test was used to compare more than 2 group. The results were considered significant when (P ≤ .05).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearson correlation was used to correlate continuous data.\n",

    "4 DISCUSSION\n",
    "The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of post‐COVID‐19 fatigue and anhedonia and the possible effect of duration of recover from the coronavirus pandemic to both anhedonia and fatigue, and to our knowledge, it is among the leading published research investigating the prevalence of fatigue and anhedonia in post‐COVID‐19 period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current study found high score of fatigue in post‐COVID‐19 patients, this is in agreement with Huang, et al12 who noted that most patients in post‐COVID‐19 period developed muscle ache, arthralgia, weakness, fatigue, or myalgia. Also, this study concluded high scores of different domains of anhedonia which is unique and novel, this is in accordance with Préau et al13 study mentioned that anhedonia was very common in viral epidemic like HIV‐infected patients with highly active antiretroviral therapies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this study was unique regarding evaluation not only the total anhedonia score but also: total intensity, total frequency, and total change scores which were not assessed by other studies during the period after recovery from COVID‐19.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current study evidenced positive correlation between fatigue and anhedonia in post‐COVID‐19 period, and this is in the same way of Zhang et al14 who said that 38% of people stopped going to workplace due to the pandemic in China,25% stopped working at all and experienced high levels of psychological distress, fatigue anxiety, post‐traumatic stress disorder, and anhedonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the study evaluated the onset of anhedonia and fatigue after 2 negative PCR tests of coronavirus leading to a finding of high scores of fatigue and anhedonia during the early days after recovery, this is in parallel with Goyal et al15 mentioned during the period next 2 weeks after cure from COVID‐19, patients gradually developed sad mood, anhedonia, lethargy, anorexia, insomnia, and easy fatiguability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, post‐COVID‐19 fatigue and anhedonia were common after recovery from novel coronavirus infection that affecting the domains of life of the patients, also the duration after cure affected these 2 manifestations which evoked an important question: Are they a transient sequelae of infection or still persist even after recovery? , this needs more research.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.1 Study limitations\n",
    "The study needs more number of cases for more solid data, also the assessment was done once, and more frequent evaluation will be needed for further consolidated results.\"\"\"\n",

    " \n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "Purpose\n",
    "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the virus resulting in COVID-19 infections in nearly 4.3 million Americans with COVID-19 in the United States as of July 29, 2020, with nearly 150,000 deaths and hundreds of thousands of survivors (https://www.coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). This tutorial reviews (a) what has been reported about neurological insults in cases of COVID-19 infection, (b) what is known from similar conditions in other disorders, and (c) how that combined information can inform clinical decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method\n",
    "PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections, cognitive impairment observed following critical care, and disorders for which intermittent or chronic hypoxia is characteristic. These were combined with searches relating to cognition, brain, and communication. All searches were conducted between April 8 and May 23, 2020. Meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials addressing other critical illnesses were also included to extend findings to potential cognitive communication outcomes following COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "COVID-19 infection results in a combination of (a) respiratory infection with mechanical ventilation secondary to inadequate oxygenation, (b) inflammatory system reactivity, and (c) increased blood clotting factors. These affect central nervous system function incurring long-term cognitive communication impairment in a proportion of survivors. Diagnostic and intervention approaches for such impairments are discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "The existing literature on cognitive sequela of COVID-19 infection is small to date, but much can be learned from similar viral infections and disorders. Although COVID-19 is novel, the speech-language pathology approaches to evaluation and intervention of other populations of critical care patients are applicable. However, speech-language pathologists have not routinely been involved in these patients' acute care. As such, this is a call to action to speech-language pathologists to address the unprecedented numbers of patients who will need their services early in the disease process and throughout recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans around the world are facing their first pandemic in a century. The climbing numbers of people testing positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection, are grabbing the attention of the populous, driving social distancing to “flatten the curve” (CDC.gov). High rates of infection are leading to the overcrowding of hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) and shortages of ventilators for patients and of personal protection equipment for health care workers. There is known increased risk of COVID-19 in individuals with other serious health conditions and elderly individuals, particularly those with comorbid health conditions (Richardson et al., 2020). Although the current concerns of the health care professions are on containing the spread of the virus and saving lives, there is growing evidence that those who survive the battle with the virus may have long-term neurological consequences (Needham et al., 2020; Pinna et al., 2020; Tsivgoulis et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Thus, it is paramount that health care professionals and speech-language pathologists (SLPs), in particular, prepare to diagnose and treat the cognitive communication disorders that may arise as a result of those consequences in COVID-19 survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial provides background regarding the potential for cognitive communication impairment as a sequela of surviving critical, severe illness due to COVID-19 infection. Although data are emerging daily about survivors, this novel coronavirus is too new to provide direct knowledge for clinical decision making in speech-language pathology. For now, SLPs in the field are responding to each patient's symptoms, and referrals are largely for dysphagia, though there are reports in the ASHA Special Interest Group 2 forum and in the interim guidance from the World Health Organization (2020) about delirium in ICU patients with COVID-19. Thus, evidence from similar conditions can help to guide our practice in this pioneering age. This review will address (a) what has been reported about neurological insults in cases of COVID-19 infection, (b) what is known from similar conditions in other disorders, and (c) how that combined information can inform clinical decision making. What should become clear to the reader is that, although COVID-19 is new, the speech-language pathology approaches to evaluation and treatment of other populations of critical care patients are applicable. However, SLPs have not routinely been involved in these critically ill patients' acute care. As such, this is a call to action to SLPs to address the unprecedented numbers of patients who will need their services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method\n",
    "This tutorial's purpose is to identify the potential for brain injury and cognitive communication impairment in survivors of COVID-19 infection as well as potential next steps for evaluating and treating such impairment. Because COVID-19 is a novel virus with limited published research on its disease process, the potential for cognitive disorders was also explored in other coronaviruses, as well as in similar disorders requiring critical care. Thus, to write this tutorial, database searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted using the MeSH terms COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections, cognitive impairment observed following critical care (“critical care,” “delirium,” and “post–intensive care unit syndrome” [PICS]), and disorders for which intermittent or chronic hypoxia is characteristic (i.e., “chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder” [COPD], “chronic obstructive sleep apnea” [COSA], and “mechanical ventilation”). The root searches for each disorder were then combined with the following subtopic searches: “brain,” “inflammation,” “magnetic resonance imaging,” “cytokines,” “cognition,” and “executive function.” The role of SLPs in the evaluation and treatment of these disorders was also queried by including the terms speech and language. Results of the database searches were filtered to include only those involving human participants 18 years of age or older, published in English, and including experimental research studies and reviews. All searches were conducted between April 8 and May 23, 2020.\n",

    "Potential Neurological Consequences of COVID-19\n",
    "Hospitalizations for individuals testing positive for COVID-19 (4.6% of all cases in the United States) have primarily been in those with cough, fever, and shortness of breath (each accounting for > 80% of cases) as well as with gastrointestinal symptoms (in approximately 20% of cases; Garg, 2020). Data from the origin of COVID-19 infections in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, indicate that, of the 799 moderately to severely ill or critically ill patients admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 13 and February 12, 2020, 113 died and 161 recovered. On admission, most (64%) patients who died and only 12% of recovered patients had percutaneous oxygen saturations levels of < 93%, and all had abnormal chest radiographs with bilateral involvement in 100% of deceased and 94% of recovered patients (Chen et al., 2020). This is not surprising given that the first symptoms of COVID-19 identified in the critical care literature were respiratory distress and increased incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020). Disorders of consciousness at hospital admission were also reported in 2% of cases (Chen et al., 2020), suggesting possible central nervous system (CNS) involvement even in the early stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are only a few reports of an overtly affected CNS in patients testing positive for COVID-19. In such cases, the damaged brain tissue is seemingly separate from the infection's effects on the lungs or other organs. For example, Poyiadji et al. (2020) reports on a woman in her late 50s, with severe presumptive COVID-19 presenting with cough, fever, and altered mental state. Following several radiological assessments, she was found to have acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare complication of influenza and viral infections. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is associated with intracranial “cytokine storms” (immune system hyperinflammatory process; Mehta et al., 2020) that breakdown the blood–brain barrier and can result in symmetrical, multifocal lesions of medial temporal and thalamic cortex. Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 also has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid in cases of COVID-19–related encephalitis (Moriguchi et al., 2020; Poyiadji et al., 2020). In fact, hypoxic encephalopathy was reported in 20% of deceased patients in Wuhan (Chen et al., 2020). Similar reports were seen following the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, with patients suffering severe respiratory infection, sepsis, organ damage, and blood clotting disorder (coagulopathy; Arabi et al., 2015; Mogi et al., 2017; Takanashi, 2009). Interestingly, some symptoms (i.e., delirium, seizures, altered consciousness) following Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections were described as “reversible” because they resolved within a month. Follow-up imaging and assessment of mental status or cognition after discharge have not been reported in those cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other neurological consequences of COVID-19 may relate to co-occurring increases in coagulation factors (e.g., D-dimer and Fibrinogen levels), which are associated with poor prognoses (Panigada et al., 2020; Ranucci et al., 2020; Spiezia et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). This increase in the potential for blood clotting appears to be infection related, likely as a result of chronic inflammatory states and formation/deposition in the lungs of excess of fibrin (a protein activated when there is vessel wall injury to produce clotting to prevent blood loss; Weisel & Litvinov, 2017). These clotting factors appear to be spilling over into the circulatory system, as they do in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Jiang et al., 2008) and normal aging (Weuve et al., 2011), increasing the risk for arterial and venous thrombi, myocardial infarctions, and cerebrovascular accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, COVID-19 infections may access the CNS via breakdown of the blood–brain barrier secondary to a cytokine storm or viral entry through the nasal mucosa. COVID-19 infection in other cells of the body (cf. Wadman et al., 2020) may trigger a cytokine storm, a term that was first popularized in another epidemic—the avian H5N1 influenza pandemic (“swine flu”) of 2009—that refers to a cascade of immune system responses (Guo et al., 2020). Although immune system activation in the face of infection is the body's defense mechanism, cytokine storms risk damage to healthy tissue as a byproduct. Cytokine storms associated with a primary lung infection can circulate cytokines through the body, potentially leading to sepsis and multiple organ failure (Tisoncik et al., 2012)—a cause of death in the current COVID-19 pandemic (in 100% of deceased patients in the study of Chen et al., 2020). Furthermore, one consequence of increased cytokine activity is a breakdown of the blood–brain barrier, which allows the virus to enter the nervous system. Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that the unusual loss of the sense of smell (i.e., anosmia) in COVID-19 may be an indicator that the virus has accessed the CNS through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity (Wu et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common features can be observed across coronavirus infections, that is, COVID-19, SARS, and MERS. First, respiratory distress leads to intermittent or chronic hypoxia (reduction of oxygen delivery to the brain). Second, each has virus-related hypercoagulability that may cause strokes in major vessels. Third, the virus may affect the CNS directly, either by way of direct conveyance to brain tissue through the mucosal membranes in the nasal cavity or by blood–brain barrier breakdown via hyperimmune system activity. Each of these features may result in brain injury that can affect cognition, language, or speech functions in ways that are not yet evident in COVID-19 survivors (see Figure 1). As such, SLPs must understand the potential for brain injury in the thousands of U.S. cases so that they may prepare to provide appropriate services. To this end, the next section will focus on what is known about the effects of these three features on brain function, cognition, and cognitive communication as they are observed in other populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1.\n",
    "Figure 1. The syndrome likely to be seen following critical care for COVID-19 infections, post–intensive care unit syndrome, is the result of chronic or intermittent hypoxia, hyper–immune system activity, and/or hypercoagulability as a result of the effect of the virus on the body. Each of these may cause damage to the parts of the brain that are associated with cognition and mood, which in turn may result in cognitive communication impairment, as described in more detail in MacDonald (2017).\n",

    "Critical Illness Factors Associated With Cognitive Communication Impairment\n",
    "Prolonged Mechanical Ventilation\n",
    "COVID-19 infection resulted in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 100% of deceased patients in Wuhan (Chen et al., 2020). ARDS is the rapidly progressing life-threatening respiratory failure associated with inflammatory fluids flooding the alveoli and limiting oxygen delivery to organs (Stam et al., 2020). ARDS, unrelated to COVID-19, has a mortality rate of 25%–40% (Mikkelsen et al., 2012). Although ARDS was reported in fewer recovered than deceased patients, 16% of recovered patients in Wuhan were on mechanical ventilation during their hospital stay. Similar data are not yet available for deceased and recovered patients in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive dysfunction is often a consequence of ARDS, along with a host of other potential impairments resulting in reduced quality of life (Denke et al., 2018). In fact, cognitive impairment is estimated in 70%–100% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation and persists in approximately 20% of those 5 years later (Herridge et al., 2016; Wilcox et al., 2013). Impaired cognitive function may arise due to prolonged duration of hypoxia or mechanical ventilation (Mart & Ware, 2020). What remains unclear is whether the chronic reduction in oxygenated blood over the course of a COVID-19 infection, even in those not requiring mechanical ventilation, may also contribute. Thus, a look at other conditions with intermittent hypoxia may provide some clues about the potential outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intermittent Hypoxia\n",
    "Two conditions demonstrating cognitive impairment secondary to intermittent hypoxia are COPD and COSA. COPD is characterized by intermittent hypoxia with comorbid cardiovascular disease and low baseline oxygen saturation (< 88%, resting hypoxemia). Chronic hypoxemia can alter neurotransmitter function, and its presence is highly correlated with domain general cognitive deficits evidenced by performance on mental status screening (Thakur et al., 2018; Wen et al., 2018). Changes in neurological function are often observed in individuals with pulmonary edema or injured lungs, and vice versa, suggesting a synergistic relationship between these functions (Stevens & Puybasset, 2011). The severity of COPD and mental status impairment is associated with reductions in gray and white matter volume in prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe structures, thalamus, and caudate/striatum (Yin et al., 2019). However, these brain changes are not associated with arterial partial pressure of oxygen or blood oxygen saturation, suggesting that hypoxia alone may not be the cause.\n",
    "\n",
    "COSA is also characterized by intermittent hypoxia, though the periods of inadequate oxygenation are brief. Apnea is defined as a reduction in respiratory amplitude of > 80% for 10 s or longer during overnight polysomnography (Ayalon et al., 2010; Harper et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Lutsey et al., 2016). Cognitive impairment is fairly common in untreated moderate-to-severe COSA, with particular deficits in attention, specifically vigilance, acquisition of new memories, visuospatial abilities, and executive functions (Otero et al., 2019). These deficits frequently co-occur with mood disorders. Changes in cognition and mood in COSA are associated with reductions or adaptations of gray and white matter brain tissue (cf. Castronovo et al., 2014; Joo et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2016; Torelli et al., 2011) as well as alterations of task-related (Ayalon et al., 2010; Castronovo et al., 2009; X. Zhang et al., 2011) and resting-state (Park et al., 2016; Yaouhi et al., 2009; Q. Zhang et al., 2015) brain function. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of brain imaging findings in COSA indicates a convergence of brain tissue changes in the right amygdala and anterior insula, which are integral to brain networks essential for sensory perception, emotion (anger, fear, happiness), interoception (air hunger [dyspnea], sexuality), and memory (Tahmasian et al., 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypercoagulability\n",
    "Virus-associated hyperinflammation is associated with risk for blood clotting or sepsis-induced coagulopathy in the lungs, legs, and brain (Hess et al., 2020). Venous and arterial thrombotic complications are estimated in as many as 31% of COVID-19 patients (Klok et al., 2020); therefore, an influx of critically ill stroke patients with this pandemic is likely. As in other instances of stroke, physicians treating COVID-19 cases are considering the use of tissue plasminogen activator and other anticoagulants (Klok et al., 2020) but are aware of the complexity of the cases given the two other features—hyperimmune activity and hypoxia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delirium\n",
    "Delirium is a cytokine-mediated activation of microglia and astrocytes associated with acute brain dysfunction. It is characterized by quickly developing fluctuations in attention (focused, sustained, or shifting) and awareness (orientation) and may also involve cognitive disturbance (“The DSM-5 Criteria, Level of Arousal and Delirium Diagnosis,” 2014, p. 5). Importantly, this fluctuation is particularly characteristic of delirium and not seen in dementia or other forms of cognitive impairment (Hopkins & Jackson, 2006). Delirium occurs in up to 70% of critically ill older adults in ICUs (Wang et al., 2018), and its presence and duration is the strongest risk factor for the persistence of cognitive impairment following recovery. Its presentation is often accompanied by myopathy or polyneuropathy due to long-term debilitation in an ICU, along with psychological comorbidities (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]; Mart & Ware, 2020). Premorbid cognitive impairment is associated with the likelihood of further impairment after delirium, but even in those with little or no impairment at baseline, delirium independently predicted poorer outcomes (Francis & Kapoor, 1992). Thus, the illness-related features that result in delirium likely alter brain function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least four subtypes of delirium (Girard et al., 2018) associated with separable mechanisms of action. These include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "hypoxic: secondary to chronic or intermittent hypoxia;\n",
    "septic: secondary to cytokine-mediated organ and brain damage due to microglial activation;\n",
    "metabolic: secondary to renal or hepatic dysfunction; and\n",
    "sedative related: secondary to use of medications in critical care.\n",
    "These causative mechanisms alter the brain in differing ways. For example, positive end-expiratory pressure–induced impairment of cerebral venous outflow and systemic return can result simultaneously in increased intracranial pressure and reduced blood flow to the brain (Sasannejad et al., 2019). Cytokine activation of microglia may result in increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier and accumulation of amyloid-β (Sasannejad et al., 2019). All four delirium subtypes may result in transient or permanent changes in brain function, resulting in cognitive impairment months and years later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delirium is further characterized by hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed states. The hyperactive state is characterized by anxious or agitated behavior with increased psychomotor activity, whereas the hypoactive state presents as depression or sedation with decreased psychomotor activity. Importantly, the more common hypoactive state may be easily missed or dismissed in the emergency department or ICU (Han et al., 2009). Delirium risk factors are largely weighted on premorbid and comorbid disease (e.g., visual or hearing impairment, cerebrovascular disease, terminal illness), though age, male gender, and previous alcohol or drug use or abuse increase the risk (Wilber & Ondrejka, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Presence and duration of delirium in critical illness are predictive of cognitive impairment 12 months after discharge. This persistence of cognitive symptoms, along with the inability to carry out activities of daily living, is termed post-ICU syndrome (PICS; Colbenson et al., 2019). PICS is seen in several critical illnesses and is associated with unmitigated delirium (Kotfis et al., 2020). A multicenter study of a large cohort of critically ill patients identified that hypoxic and sedative-related subtypes of delirium were associated with PICS, evidenced by poor performance on the global cognitive scores of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Randolph, 1998) at 3 months and 1 year postdischarge (Girard et al., 2018). Septic delirium also predicted RBANS scores at the 1-year follow-up. Importantly, study participants tended not to have an isolated subtype of delirium. That is, a patient who is critically ill with COVID-19 infection may have systemic inflammatory activity with the potential for sepsis and may also be sedated during prolonged mechanical ventilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To date, there are not reports about cognitive outcomes in COVID-19 infection, but the other disorders with similar critical illness conditions reported here lend some predictive value. The common cognitive findings across the disorders reviewed above are slightly difficult to specify, as several of the investigations, particularly for COPD and delirium, have only screened cognitive function using either the Mini-Mental State Examination (Folstein et al., 1975) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nasreddine et al., 2005). These screens provide preliminary evidence of impairment but do not provide specific data about affected cognitive domains. Nonetheless, it is highly likely that, consistent with PICS, COVID-19 survivors will present with deficits in attention, memory, and executive function, as well as psychomotor or visuospatial performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential for Comorbid Psychiatric Conditions\n",
    "Psychiatric comorbidities, including PTSD, anxiety, or depression, are known to influence cognitive function. Along with the cognitive and physical symptoms, PICS is also marked by the presence of mood disorders (Marra et al., 2018), which contribute to a person's well-being and, consequently, their cognitive ability. The interplay between mood and cognitive functioning is particularly mingled early in recovery, such that mood disorders may affect subjective measures of cognition as well as complaints of fatigue and perceptions of quality of life (Brück et al., 2019). Furthermore, the presence of any mood disorder will make the diagnosis of delirium more complicated because individuals with depression or PTSD will present with cognitive symptoms associated with that mood disorder. For example, memory impairments in major depressive disorder are well documented (Ahern & Semkovska, 2017), as are attention and executive function deficits in PTSD (McKinnon et al., 2016), and intrusive memories are common in both populations (Payne et al., 2019). Although PTSD, anxiety, and depression are beyond an SLP's scope of practice, their potential impact on the presentation of cognitive communication impairment following COVID-19 infection is critical for SLPs to recognize. When these factors are suspected, referral to appropriate psychological services is warranted (Paul-Brown & Ricker, 2002). Although treatment for these mood disorders will not be a focus of speech-language therapy, the impact of these disorders on cognitive communication must be understood and addressed (cf. Ponsford et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical, financial, logistic, mood, and cognitive (McIntyre et al., 2020) concerns will likely plague those recovering from COVID-19 infection. Screening of mood disorders is warranted throughout the continuum of care. Though it may be under the purview of psychological services in some settings, the entire team should make observations and note symptoms (recommendations per Brück et al., 2019). As with many clinical populations, comorbid psychiatric conditions can hinder intervention outcomes when not addressed. The entire rehabilitation team should be mindful of the “whole person,” and referrals should be made to address psychological well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical Recommendations for COVID-19 Cognitive Communication Impairment Following COVID-19\n",
    "The potential cognitive outcomes for COVID-19 survivors are best characterized by PICS, along with the potential for comorbid stroke. PICS is expected to be present in an unprecedented number of COVID-19 survivors (Stam et al., 2020) who will need care early on and throughout their recovery. In fact, Stam et al. 2020 have initiated a call for action to rehabilitation professionals. Two essential elements in this call are (a) screening by an interprofessional team, beginning early in the intensive care stay, and (b) a reliance on systematic reviews of rehabilitation interventions for guidance. Stam et al. stress that it is “important to turn to…rehabilitation medicine and their multiprofessional teams who are equipped and experienced in providing the necessary interventions for mental, cognitive, and physical impairments of the consequences of intensive care and mechanical ventilation” (pp. 3–4).\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to that call, SLPs are in a unique position to guide the treatment of cognitive communication deficits that may be present. This tutorial's descriptions of COVID-19's potential effects on the brain should illustrate that, although COVID-19 is novel, the cognitive and linguistic symptoms SLPs will observe in survivors are not novel. Nonetheless, the abundance of patients in critical care units provides an opportunity for practicing SLPs to recognize and broaden their role. Although there is a dearth of evidence regarding cognitive communication impairments in the ICU, acute, or inpatient rehabilitation settings, evidence from outpatient settings can serve as a roadmap. Additional guidance may come from an emerging literature on posttraumatic amnesia/delirium and other cognitive communication symptoms often seen in traumatic brain injury, which centers on evaluation and intervention for such impairments (Ponsford et al., 2014; Steel et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following recommendations address the cognitive communication impairment that may be present in COVID-19 survivors. Poststroke aphasia or communication disorders associated with right hemisphere are not specifically addressed, though a thorough evaluation of speech and language is recommended (see Ramsey & Blake, 2020; Vallila-Rohter et al., 2018, for suggestions). Even in the presence of aphasia or right hemisphere communication disorder, comorbid cognitive impairment or mood disturbances should be considered in evaluation and intervention, as these comorbidities negatively influence functional outcomes (Revet et al., 2019). Thus, SLPs are urged to evaluate cognition and its cumulative effects on communication in COVID-19–related stroke survivors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recent special section on COVID-19 and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (Frontera, 2020) highlights several recommendations—objective and subjective evaluation, interprofessional rehabilitation, patient and family education, and consideration of comorbid conditions—that are relevant to speech-language pathology practice. Below is a nonexhaustive set of suggestions for cognitive communication evaluation and intervention based on those recommendations, along with evidence from the literature for suggestions about implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prehabilitation Phase\n",
    "The primary concern in the acute care setting, particularly in the ICU, is survival. In most cases, this will involve SLPs for swallowing and feeding. However, if the SLP in that setting also charts baseline cognitive function, communication, and mood, then the next level of care will be able to assess change. This is similar to that suggested as “prehabilitation” by Silver (2020), to have wide adoption of physical and psychological assessments to document onset and development of symptoms early in critical care. An example of implementing a common evaluation tool for language within a health care system in acute care is reported by Vallila-Rohter et al. (2018).\n",
    "n\n",
    "Evaluation. Administering objective and subjective measures of cognitive function is highly recommended throughout the stages of care—that is, pre- and rehabilitation (Brück et al., 2019). Subjective (self-report) measures may indicate an interaction between psychological and cognitive symptoms that could be predictive of mood disorders, whereas objective measures can indicate more accurately the presence of a cognitive impairment that could be addressed in rehabilitation. Also, subjective measurements may indicate subtle or mild cognitive impairments not detected or found to be within normal limits on objective measures, but that nonetheless differ from premorbid function. Recommended sources for evaluation in the ICU and acute care settings include objective mental status screens, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or measures more specific to delirium in critical illness and could be administered, for example, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU; Ely et al., 2001). Assessment of alertness and agitation may also be warranted, such as the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) scores (Wassenaar, Rood, et al., 2018). A subjective measure to indicate the different aspects of cognitive function on subjective relative to objective assessments in delirium that has been used in the ICU is the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (Broadbent et al., 1982; Brück et al., 2019; Wassenaar, de Reus, et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Screening for delirium, likely conducted by physicians and nurses, is needed and often involves use of a rating scale (e.g., the Glasgow Coma Scale; Teasdale & Jennett, 1974; RASS). Additional screening for cognition is also necessary and may be conducted using mental status screeners and confusion assessments in the critical care setting (e.g., the CAM [Inouye et al., 1990] or the CAM-ICU [Ely et al., 2001]). Tracking change on such screens throughout the continuum of care will be beneficial in understanding the implications on cognitive impairment in recovery. Although the SLP is not likely the service provider administering these measures, the team of service providers (including the SLP) should agree upon and consistently acquire these measures to document for prehabilitation and to inform the rehabilitation effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timing of intervention in the recovery process for cognition and communication is a primary consideration in evaluation of cognitive impairment in critical illness. As mentioned above, one source of delirium in the ICU is sedating and analgesic medications that can alter cognitive functions. Two of the seven studies reviewed by Deemer et al. (2020) staged cognitive intervention protocols based on the sedation levels of the participants using the RASS. That is, patients who were unarousable or deeply sedated were not treated, those who were moderately or lightly sedated took part in orientation exercises only, and those considered drowsy to alert took part in the complete intervention. This staging of the intervention protocol is reasonable, yielded appreciable improvement in cognitive outcomes, and provides a guide for clinicians across settings to begin employing diagnostics and intervention, similar to the utility of the Rancho Los Amigos Scale (Whyte, 2011) in traumatic brain injury.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assessments provide common pieces of information that may be used across disciplines and setting and some data to discuss with the patient and family. Having the family/caregivers involved in the rehabilitation team will also be beneficial. For example, positive outcomes are emerging for the use of ICU diaries, completed by ICU staff and family/caregivers, that are used after discharge to other units or to home, to help in clarifying for the patient the reality of the experience (Garrouste-Orgeas et al., 2017). These diaries have not been shown to reduce posttraumatic stress in ICU patients but could be utilized to support orientation and memory in intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervention. Intervention approaches may be based, for example, on the recommendations of the International Cognitive Team (Ponsford et al., 2014; Togher et al., 2014) and more generally on those of Sohlberg and Turkstra (2011) for optimizing outcomes in cognitive communication intervention for SLPs. Although these recommendations are centered on service delivery in traumatic brain injury, the same principles generally apply for managing PICS. From the evaluation, the SLP should identify the individual's communication strengths and weaknesses, focusing on the modalities that are best understood (auditory or visual) and produced (verbal, written, gesture, pointing). Once the best mode for communicating is identified, the interprofessional team should be informed so that instructions can be routinely presented and elicited in the best modalities. This will optimize communication with the patient and will be a starting place for interprofessional intervention planning. For example, the intervention may focus initially on orientation to time, place, and person to reduce confusion. If a patient's best modality for communication is visual, then the SLP may develop orienting materials that can be placed prominently in the patient's room and used by all professionals and family members interacting in the patient's care. Spaced retrieval (cf. Hopper et al., 2005) may be used as an approach to strengthen memory for orientation facts and reinforced with all health care providers who visit a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rehabilitation Phase Evaluation\n",
    "Once a COVID-19 patient is stable and able to engage in a longer diagnostic session, a self-report and/or informant report rating scale that assesses executive function, in particular in a person's day-to-day life, is warranted (e.g., Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function–Adult; Roth et al., 2005). The Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function–Adult provides the perspective of an informant (caregiver) who may have insight into the change in ability relative to pre–COVID-19 that may not be as clear to the patient yet. Next, a comprehensive cognitive communication battery will provide a glimpse into the nature of the cognitive impairment—executive function, memory, or attention—and how it is affecting communication (e.g., RBANS or Cognitive–Linguistic Quick Test; Helm-Estabrooks, 2018). Alternatively, the NIH Toolbox (Gershon et al., 2013) is a compendium of psychometrically sound standardized assessment tools with a large normative data set and is administered on an iPad. The NIH Toolbox Cognitive and Emotion batteries have published normative data (e.g., Akshoomoff et al., 2014) that are built in to the assessment that will provide results immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in recovery, consideration for social communication may also be important to determine if and how a cognitive communication impairment or mood disorder may be affecting relationships. For this, the La Trobe Questionnaire (Douglas et al., 2000) is a standardized measure with extensive normative data that has been used in several neurogenic communication disorders. Although the La Trobe Questionnaire is primarily a social communication measure, it taps into several behaviors that are reliant on cognition and language (e.g., memory deficits, disinhibition/impulsivity, providing insufficient information, word-finding difficulty), as listed by the authors (Douglas et al., 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "Any of these assessments will provide data regarding potential deficits in attention and working memory, episodic memory, word list learning, visuospatial processing, and executive functions. They will provide vital information in determining strengths and weaknesses across cognitive domains that can guide decision making for cognitive communication intervention, as well as for advising modifications for other service providers. For example, the findings will inform the clinician about the information to provide for patient and family education, in which modalities to provide that information (verbal or written instruction), and the appropriate interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intervention: Need for Interprofessional Rehabilitation Approaches\n",
    "Interprofessional rehabilitation, beginning early and continuing throughout the acute hospital stay, is essential in the care for individuals with PICS. Several randomized controlled trials are currently underway focusing on combinations of physical and cognitive training (cf. Fuke et al., 2018; Kondo et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018), though most of these are being conducted by investigators in critical care medicine and not specific to the rehabilitation approaches that may be most advantageous over time. The data on interprofessional intervention approaches for delirium highlight the importance of early physical mobility to potentially improve at least the short-term physical concerns in PICS (Fuke et al., 2018; Kondo et al., 2017; Maheswaran et al., 2020). There are very few cognitive intervention trials for delirium or individuals in critical care in the literature (cf. for posttraumatic amnesia and cognitive communication impairment in Steel et al., 2017; Togher et al., 2014), with only seven reported in a recent systematic review (Deemer et al., 2020). That review concludes that there is insufficient evidence to indicate its use for PICS. Deemer et al. 2020 categorized the intervention strategies in these studies as either training (repeating standardized tasks), stimulation (group activities to enhance cognitive and social functioning), or rehabilitation (individualized approaches to improving functional abilities). Most of the studies were considered stimulation or a combination of training + stimulation and thus did not address rehabilitation. Furthermore, in all of these studies, there was poor description of the intervention procedures with lack of adequate experimental design to indicate generalizability/transfer of treatment effects. Nonetheless, the effects on outcome measures tended to be positive, providing support for the idea that early rehabilitation can reduce the incidence of delirium in critically ill patients. Of concern is that, in all of the studies of cognitive interventions in PICS reviewed by Deemer et al., none involved SLPs. This is a shortcoming in the field that needs attention, particularly as COVID-19 is increasing the numbers of patients who will benefit from the unique knowledge and specialization in cognitive communication impairment that SLPs have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the SLP referrals may be requested to assess postextubation effects on voice or dysphagia (Brodsky et al., 2020), it is imperative to recognize the potential for cognitive communication impairment and need for modifications of recommendations as part of the intervention plan. For example, if a patient has postextubation vocal trauma and has PICS, it may be that instructions and demonstrations utilized as part of the voice therapy will need to be written and practiced with high numbers of repetition, improving compliance to therapy procedures, or a patient may be more compliant with a medication schedule or exercise regimen if each is entered into a personal device with alarms as reminders with simple, written instructions. These modifications are reliant on the SLP identifying the modalities most effective for each patient. Last, rehabilitation should be continued in outpatient or at home—either in person or by telepractice (Lew et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusions\n",
    "With the COVID-19 pandemic comes a high likelihood of unprecedented numbers of survivors who may suffer from cognitive impairment. This is because the body's reaction to this novel coronavirus includes lung infection, which reduces the capacity of the lungs to provide sufficient oxygen for the organs, including the brain, to function optimally—dyspnea or hypoxia. The body also reacts to this infection with a hyperimmune response, creating a cytokine storm in which tissue, including brain tissue, may be damaged. Finally, the infection may result in increasing blood clotting factors in the body (hypercoagulation), which may result in emboli that can damage the brain in a consequent cerebrovascular accident. Importantly, these results are not unique to COVID-19 and are seen in many critical care illnesses, but the number of patients who will suffer these effects is unprecedented.\n",

    "SLPs need to be aware of the potential for cognitive communication impairment and be a part of the rehabilitation team that is working to document and treat it. Diagnostic and intervention approaches should begin as early as possible in critically ill COVID-19 patients. That is, it should begin when patients are alert and only lightly sedated. Diagnostics should include objective and subjective measures of cognition as well as evaluation of mood. A primary focus of diagnostics is to document the presence or absence of impairment throughout the continuum of care, as well as to identify the level of impairment in each domain of cognitive functioning (orientation, processing speed, visuospatial processing, attention, memory, executive function) and how these affect the ability to communicate. This information will guide interactions with providers on the health care team as well as aid in planning intervention. Importantly, SLPs are essential to identifying the effects of cognitive impairment on communication early in patient care, providing recommendations to the patient, family, and interprofessional team to optimize communication of patient education and therapeutic goals.\"\"\"\n",

    "The long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown. Lessons from past viral epidemics reveal that, after recovery, patients with viral pulmonary infections can suffer from irreversible pulmonary dysfunction and demonstrate residual imaging or functional abnormalities. Residual ground glass opacities, consolidations, reticular and linear opacities, residual crazy paving pattern, melted sugar sign, and parenchymal fibrotic bands are several features found in the late or remission stages of COVID-19. These radiologic findings have been observed weeks after symptom onset, even after hospital discharge, and they may or may not correlate with clinical manifestations. High-resolution CT may be indicated to establish new baselines and track changes in residual impairments. In our previous review, we observed significant pulmonary sequelae in some COVID-19 survivors at follow-up. In this update, we review the current literature on the clinical and radiologic manifestations of post-recovery COVID-19 toward the end of hospital admission and after discharge.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "In December 2019, a severe respiratory illness outbreak appeared in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, later termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome—Coronavirus—2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Infection by SARS-CoV-2, termed Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), causes most commonly fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea [1,2,3,4,5]. In severe cases, COVID-19 results in severe acute respiratory syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Multiple different extrapulmonary findings and manifestations have been also described in this disease. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus. Given the alarming number of cases and deaths, the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic in early March 2020 [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past several months, the risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of COVID-19 have been investigated in numerous publications. Older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases are all associated with higher rates of respiratory failure, ICU admission, and mortality [2,3,4]. Although there is published literature describing the clinical and radiologic progression and course of COVID-19 throughout the hospital stay, there is a scarce of literature describing how that progression should guide management at discharge and post-discharge surveillance. In our previous review, we noted that past epidemics including the first SARS and avian flu H7N9 can result in permanent pulmonary damage, observable on chest CT many years after the acute pneumonia. We observed significant pulmonary sequelae in some COVID-19 survivors at follow-up as well [5,6,7]. The purpose of this update is to review the literature in the past several months on the clinical and radiologic features of COVID-19 toward the end of hospital admission and after discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical findings of COVID-19 at and after discharge\n",
    "Most studies clinically stage COVID-19 infection from the onset of symptoms. The number, duration, nomenclature, and discharge criteria for these stages are highly variable across multiple studies. In a rapid advice guideline, Jin et al. find that COVID-19 can be staged anywhere from two to seven stages, depending on the management perspective. In the most general sense, COVID-19 progression can be categorized simply as early or late stage. On the other hand, the progression can be staged more granularly (ultra-early, early, rapid progression, consolidation, and dissipation) [8]. This variability arises from the diversity in clinical presentation and other factors. The discharge criteria in many of these studies are unclear, and few have reported short-term (1–2 months) follow-ups on COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not mentioned in many studies from China, standardized discharge criteria for COVID-19 have been recommended by the China National Health Commission [9]. As noted by Zheng et al., studies have commonly used the following discharge criteria: (1) two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests; (2) improvements in chest radiography or chest CT; (3) improvement in clinical symptoms, vitals, and laboratory studies; and (4) corticosteroids completely discontinued for more than 1 week with the other criteria met. However, these criteria are not uniform across studies. For instance, the interval time between negative RT-PCR tests can be between 24 and 96 h or longer. Improvement in imaging findings may include reduction in the number and size or resolution of GGOs, decrease in the consolidation density, melted sugar sign (gradual reduction in the density of pulmonary consolidation and transition to ground glass opacity), and residual fibrous stripes/fibrotic bands. Clinical improvement may be defined as (1) normal body temperature for three to seven days or longer; (2) normal blood oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen; (3) normal laboratory studies; and (4) symptomatic improvement [10]. These criteria do not include pulmonary function testing or spirometry. Notably, Mo et al. find that, while meeting the criteria at discharge, patients demonstrated reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) and predicted total lung capacity (TLC). Patients in the severe pneumonia group had significantly reduced DLCO and TLC compared to both the mild illness and pneumonia groups. Furthermore, the blood oxygen saturation was not different across the mild illness, pneumonia, and severe pneumonia groups [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these discharge criteria, studies have shown laboratory and clinical abnormalities, persistent and/or relapsing. Cases of RT-PCR positivity after hospital discharge have been reported [9, 10, 12]. RT-PCR testing of the lower respiratory tract may show positivity for up to two weeks, while testing urine or stool may show positivity for up to four weeks. Other laboratory abnormalities include progressive lymphopenia and progressive neutrophilia. Relapsing clinical features include fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and shortness of breath [10]. In Xing Y et al., two medical staff who contracted and recovered from COVID-19 infection underwent multiple repeat RT-PCR testing for up to 12 days post-discharge. Although both cases reported no symptoms, RT-PCR showed weakly positive in two instances and positive in one instance for each case [12]. In Dou et al., a father and his daughter both hospitalized with COVID-19 were both discharged on February 9. Both met the criteria of two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests with at least 24 h interval at discharge. The father and daughter were in isolation at home for 17 days until February 26 when they each received an additional RT-PCR test and HRCT. Both follow-up RT-PCR tests were positive. While significantly improved from the last CTs of their hospital admissions, both follow-up CT scans showed persistent abnormalities. The study notes no evidence of reinfection or person-to-person transmission [9]. In Fu W et al., three patients previously discharged tested positive on subsequent RT-PCR, prompting readmission although asymptomatic. The times from the first discharge to second readmission were 7, 12, and 9 days. During readmission, the repeat HRCT of case 2 showed residual airspace opacity. Repeat HRCTs of case 1 and 3 showed no residual pulmonary opacity. Repeat antibody testing showed negative IgM and positive IgG for all patients. At the second discharge, they again had two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests, were discharged, and were encouraged to isolate for 14 days in a hotel [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "Histologically, Yao et al. illustrate that even in a COVID-19 patient anticipating discharge, there is pathological evidence for residual abnormalities after recovery. In their case report, an elderly COVID-19 patient met criteria and expected discharge when she suddenly experienced a fatal cardiac arrest. Although nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing was negative, further testing on lung sections showed clear viral particles in bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial (AE) cells. Biopsy demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of type II AE cells, fibrin exudation, hyaline membranes, scattered interstitial inflammation, monocytes, macrophages, and chronic respiratory disease-associated changes. Yao XH noted that these abnormalities are similar to findings in patients with SARS and MERS [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "Radiologic findings of COVID-19 at and after discharge\n",
    "Studies on radiologic progression of severe COVID-19 infection categorize the timeline of imaging findings anywhere from two to six stages with highly variable interval times and number of repeat CT scans. Pan et al. found that patients who had one interval CT scan after 3–14 days demonstrated significant changes in imaging manifestation. The findings include worsening GGOs (multifocal or solitary) or consolidations and development of fibrotic bands, organizing pneumonia, and solid nodules. Imaging signs of improvement included shrinking opacities and nodules and melted sugar signs [15]. Although Chen et al. do not divide the radiologic progression of COVID-19 into stages, patients who underwent repeat imaging showed median times of 7 and 14 days after admission for worsening and improvement, respectively, on CT. All patients underwent chest radiograph or chest CT on admission [2]. Shi et al. divide COVID-19 infection into four stages by weeks after symptom onset (group 1 = subclinical, group 2 = first week, group 3 = second week, group 4 = third week). Group 4 showed GGOs, reticular patterns, bronchiolectasis, pleural thickening, and pleural effusions [16].\n",
    "\n",
    "In a retrospective study, Liang et al. characterized CT findings semiquantitatively by assigning a severity score based on abnormalities occupying percentages of lung lobes. All cases for this study were classified as mild COVID-19 pneumonia per the WHO definition. Patients were categorized into five groups over time: group 1 (days 0–3), group 2 (days 4–7), group 3 (days 8–10), group 4 (days 11–14), and group 5 (days 15–21). There was a significant decreasing trend in patients with both GGOs and consolidation over 21 days, but there was a significant increasing trend in patients with GGOs, consolidation, and linear opacities. However, total lung CT scores were not statistically significant over time, although abnormalities tended to involve more lobes and become bilateral within the first 2 weeks of disease onset. Only 5 patients were known to have been discharged from the hospital [17].\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar study, Ding et al. used the same semiquantitative severity score, but found different results. This study divided patients into 6 stages: stage 1 (0–4 days), stage 2 (5–9 days), stage 3 (10–14 days), stage 4 (15–21 days), stage 5 (22–28 days), and stage 6 (> 28 days). Contrary to the previous study, differences in CT scores were significant over time, but only in certain lobes. Lower lobes of the lungs were more frequently involved, with significantly higher CT scores at any stage except stage 1. Lesions gradually spread from the periphery to the center of the lungs. Frequency of GGOs, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, and linear opacities tended to decrease over time. However, at stage 6, 98.1% of all CT scans still showed abnormalities [18].\n",
    "\n",
    "Pan et al. take the semiquantitative severity scores further by fitting a curve to the scores of hospitalized COVID-19 patients over time. Severe cases were excluded. Patients were staged as early stage (0–4 days), progressive stage (5–8 days), peak stage (9–13 days), and absorption stage (≥ 14 days) based on CT score quartiles. Peak lung involvement was at 10 days with a CT score of 6 with improvement after 14 days. The bilateral lower lobes scored significantly higher versus the all other lobes and in the peak and absorption stages. During the absorption stage, GGOs and consolidations were observed to absorb. However, based on the fitted curve on total CT scores, the absorption stage extended past 26 days (the last day of follow-up for one patient) [19].\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the diversity in staging COVID-19 clinically and radiologically, Jin et al. created a rapid advice guideline based on the current literature. Based on CT imaging, they categorize COVID-19 infection into 5 stages, the last termed a “dissipation stage.” During the dissipation stage (roughly 2–3 weeks after symptom onset), the range of lesions reduced, but did not completely resolve. Characteristic findings included patchy consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, and thickening of bronchial walls. The criteria for discharge include (1) body temperature within normal for ≥ 3 days, (2) improved respiratory symptoms, (3) obvious signs of absorption in the lungs, (4) two consecutive negative RT-PCR tests with at least 1 day sampling interval, and (5) ability to discontinue isolation. This rapid advice guideline does not provide recommendations on follow-up after discharge [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Possibility of long-term pulmonary abnormalities\n",
    "The literature reports some consistency in the clinical and radiological status of COVID-19 patients at and after discharge. In general, most studies use the same four discharge criteria, but there are inconsistencies in the interval timing of repeat RT-PCR testing and the duration of normal clinical plus laboratory values [10]. Multiple studies find 10 days as the peak of clinical and radiological severity as well as 14 days as a common point for beginning improvement. As mentioned above, several studies use the same chest CT severity scoring system, but only one fits a curve to the data to predict the possible long-term duration of radiological findings [19]. Up to 98.1% of all chest CTs will show abnormalities at > 28 days since symptom onset [18], and many case reports with post-discharge surveillance chest CTs still show abnormalities even though improved [9, 13]. Clinical and radiological staging is still variable across many studies. Considering the radiological data, imaging abnormalities are highly likely to persist in recovered COVID-19 patients. Our limited observations of new survivors are consistent with those in other studies (Figs. 1 and 2). How long these imaging abnormalities persist has yet to be investigated, but these data support long-term pulmonary consequences that we speculated in previous reviews [5,6,7].\n",

    "A 64-year-old woman presented with myalgia and low-grade fever to the emergency department. Baseline CT examination showed multifocal patchy ground glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening (a, b). The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed later by RT-PCR. Follow-up imaging 35 days after initial CT demonstrated residual pure ground glass opacity without focal pleural thickening (c, d)\n",

Multifocal bilateral peripheral ground glass opacities were identified (a, b), consistent with COVID-19. He returned for follow-up imaging 34 days after the initial presentation. Follow-up non-contrast chest CT demonstrates residual pulmonary opacities and fibrotic bands involving peripheral bilateral lung bases (c–e)\n",
    "\n",
    "Full size image\n",
    "Although the severity of CT findings do not always correlate with severity of clinical manifestations [20, 21], there is evidence that COVID-19 is far from over at hospital discharge. However, it is still unclear whether patients are still contagious and whether lung damage is still occurring. For instance, given positive IgG levels after discharge [13], where patients fall in the timeline of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown. On pathology, the observed signs of chronic lung damage and presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles at discharge suggest long-term pulmonary consequences. For example, these findings were observed in one case at one time point postmortem [14]. Also, in a recent publication in Lancet Infectious disease [22], a total of eight COVID-19 patients who died from the disease were undergone postmortem histopathologic evaluation of tissue samples obtained by cryobiopsy within 30 min of death. The authors reported significant fibrotic pulmonary parenchymal remodeling, as characterized by fibroblast proliferation, micro-honeycombing, and airspace obliteration. Although intriguing, lung biopsies place patients at high risk of pneumothorax and are impractical. However, a recent report of transbronchial biopsy in a 61-year-old female COVID-19 patient demonstrated organizing pneumonia [23], which is a different pathology than fibrotic bands (Fig. 2). To our knowledge, no other studies have performed repeat lung biopsies for post-discharge surveillance. Most studies perform repeat HRCTs, but given the inherent radiation, there may be a role for low-dose or ultra-low-dose CTs in longitudinal follow-ups [24]. This is important to understand organizing pneumonia can develop either an active or aberrant pulmonary repair or recovery process during the evolution of COVID-19 [25]. Like any other etiology of organizing pneumonia, the imaging manifestation may include pulmonary consolidations and opacities in peri-bronchovascular or peri-lobular distribution, reticulation, bronchiectasis, interstitial or airspace nodules, interlobular septal thickening or even the reversed halo sign and the halo sign [26]. However, no large sample longitudinal follow-up of patients recovered from COVID-19 has been reported to date to provide a statistical estimate of the prevalence of different imaging manifestations, such as organizing pneumonia, fibrotic bands, reticulation, or honeycombing. Whether there is any overlap between the residual pulmonary consequences of COVID-19 pneumonia and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) is not known yet. In addition, there is a surprising lack of pulmonary function testing and spirometry in patients at and after discharge. Considering the findings from Mo et al.—that DLCO and TLC can be reduced despite meeting discharge criteria—residual pulmonary dysfunction is expected. Also, because blood oxygen levels were normal across all mild illness, pneumonia, and severe pneumonia groups in the study [11], it is possible that current discharge criteria are insufficient and/or inaccurate in determining pulmonary and functional status.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chest radiographs can also be employed for the follow-up imaging of patients recovered from COVID-19; however, subtle parenchymal changes might not be detected on radiographs due to lower tissue resolution and overlapping tissues obscuring underlying pulmonary alterations. In fact, CT is a more sensitive means of evaluation of pulmonary parenchymal distortion. However, the choice of imaging modality depends on the clinical scenario and healthcare resources [27,28,29,30].\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this scattering of data, methodology, and interpretations, long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection are difficult to predict. Indeed, expert opinions on practice guidelines and rehabilitation have been proposed [5,6,7,8, 10, 27], but all have yet to be validated in sufficiently powered longitudinal studies. Although current healthcare systems continue to see overwhelming numbers of new COVID-19 cases, more longitudinal studies are needed. The progression of COVID-19 clinically and radiologically remains uncertain [31, 32], but there is some evidence that consequences can persist for more than a month. Even if patients are found to be asymptomatic weeks or months after discharge, the possibility of insidious infection or persistent infectivity cannot be ruled out. In addition, residual abnormalities in pulmonary function and radiologic findings will be pertinent in long-term management of patients for many years to come. This can be even more prominent and common in patients with underlying pulmonary or extra-pulmonary diseases [33,34,35,36]. Post-discharge surveillance and monitoring will be necessary to avoid a cohort with chronic or permanent lung damage. Thus, continued surveillance of discharged COVID-19 patients with repeat pulmonary function testing, RT-PCR, and HRCT is recommended.\"\"\"\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Given that a very large number of individuals will be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the immediate impact on mental health could be considerable. Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the aftermath (Rogers et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pleomorphic RNA viruses whose crown-shaped peplomers are 80 to 160 nM in size, with positive polarity of 27 to 32 kb, belonging to the Coronaviridae family and to the order Nidovirales. The model of the molecular structure of the coronavirus can be seen in Fig. 1 . CoVs spread pathologically in the respiratory, intestinal, hepatic and nervous systems and are considered harmful to humans since their association with acute respiratory syndromes (Sahin, 2020; Yin, 2020; Correia et al., 2020). Historically, coronaviruses have been responsible for two notable outbreaks: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) respectively in 2002 and 2012. Suddenly, cases of atypical pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China, which were associated with the new coronavirus responsible for Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2), later called COVID-19 (Rogers et al., 2020). The initial clinical descriptions of this infectious pathology consisted mainly of respiratory symptoms. Although COVID-19 is largely responsible for the clinical worsening of the infectious condition, atypical presentations are being increasingly recognized (Beach et al., 2020).\n",

    "\n",
    "With regard to atypical presentations, coping with the pandemic situation regarding COVID-19 is a significant psychiatric stressor, due to the substantial impact on all facets of life and organizations of individuals in the social and economic sectors (Troyer et al., 2020). Evidence about the symptoms indicate that deliriums are common to acute stages of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, fatigue and post-traumatic stress disorder were evidenced after the acute stages in epidemics previous to coronaviruses, but the data for COVID-19 are still scarce (Rogers et al., 2020). However, in addition to the psychological distress associated with the pandemic, the direct effects of the virus itself and the subsequent immune response of the host on the human central nervous system (CNS) and the results are still poorly known (Troyer et al., 2020). In converging perspectives, it is known that viral infections are epidemiologically prevalent and some of them are harmful to the central nervous system (CNS) due to the development of neuropsychiatric syndromes which affect the cognitive, affective, behavioral and perceptual domains (Rogers et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous pandemic events suggest that neuropsychiatric symptoms manifest themselves in acute viral infection or after varying periods of time after infection. (Jasti et al., 2020). Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, suicide and delirium marked the pandemic flu of the 18th and 19th centuries (Troyer et al., 2020; Honigsbaum, 2013; Menninger, 1926). The CNS inflammatory disorder called Encephalitis lethargica (EL) characterized by hypersomnolence, psychosis, catatonia and parkinsonism had an increase in its rates during the Spanish Flu pandemic in the 20th century. More recently, neuropsychiatric sequelae have been reported, such as narcolepsy, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes related to SARS-CoV-1, MERS and H1N1 (Troyer et al., 2020). On the other hand, the SARS-Cov-2 enters the human host cells through the agiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, which has low levels of expression in the brain; however, there are preliminary evidences in vitro of the ability to replicate in neuronal cells, which differs from other previous coronaviruses (Rogers et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The simultaneity between the progressive expansion of new cases of COVID-19 and serious psychiatric implications is notorious. This is mainly due to the broad social impact of the pandemic situation and the government responses to social distancing and quarantines (Troyer et al., 2020). Infected and uninfected populations may be susceptible to generalized anxiety and stress in response to certain experiences. Other experiences may be specific to individuals infected by the virus, among them, the concern with the prognosis of their illness, stigma or traumatic memories of serious illnesses (Rogers et al., 2020). Fears of illness, death and uncertainty about the future are significant psychological stressors for the population, and the social isolation resulting from the loss of structured educational and work activities also threatens to worsen public mental health. This pandemic is a potential source of direct and indirect trauma for everyone, which is only further emphasized by disturbing case reports of suicide deaths related to fear of contracting or spreading COVID-19 (Troyer et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is estimated that more than a third of patients with COVID-19 develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, including headache, paresthesia and disturbed consciousness, and those symptoms appear to be associated with more serious illnesses (Beach et al., 2020). Even though some authors suggest that serious neuropsychiatric implications are rare, a considerable number of individuals worldwide could be affected. Pandemics prior to influenza have been associated with long-term neuropsychiatric repercussions and, therefore, it is possible that other large-scale viral infections may cause sustained mental morbidity (Rogers et al., 2020). Therefore, we aim to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions of COVID-19 based on epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical foundations observed in previous and recent pandemic events, and also to make a proposition about effective therapeutic interventions to help tackle this serious public health problem, more specifically in its neuropsychiatric developments.\n",

    "3. Disorders and epidemiological profiles\n",
    "By the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread from China to the rest of the continents (Jasti et al., 2020), corresponding to more than 4,170,000 cases and 287,399 deaths, according to the statement World Health Organization (WHO) carried out on May 13, 2020 (Zhou et al., 2020). The COVID-19 takes, thereby, a pandemic feature, whose landmark is its effects on the respiratory system and its more serious manifestation: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Troyer et al., 2020.). Due to the ability to generate multiple infections to systemic organs (Jasti et al., 2020), the referred virus can cause damage to the kidneys, heart, liver and brain, for example (Dinakaran et al., 2020). From a neurological perspective, individuals affected by the virus have reported headache, dizziness, hypogeusia and hyposmia during the course of the disease, with intensive care patients being more likely to complain of dizziness (Zhou et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the reported neurological impairments, neuropsychiatric sequelae are also imminent in view of the diversity of stress elements during the pandemic, such as fear of the disease, uncertainty of the future, in addition to the frequent exposure and the shortage of private protective equipment suffered by health professionals in the frontline. Thus, symptoms may appear after the infectious period: insomnia, depression, anxiety, psychosis, among other manifestations (Troyer et al., 2020). According to studies reviewed by Rogers et al., 2020, patients admitted to hospital due to SARS or MERS during the acute phase of the disease had psychiatric impairment factors: depressed mood (32.6%), anxiety (35.7%), impaired memory (34.1%) and insomnia (42%). Moreover, researches also addressed by the aforementioned meta-analysis points out the neuropsychiatric repercussion in the post-infectious period, demonstrating the persistence of depressed mood and anxiety, in addition to the development of euphoria (10.8%), irritability (12.8%), fatigue (19.3%), emotional lability (23.5%) and traumatic memories (30.4%).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an important finding, confusion during the acute phase of SARS and MERS occurred in 27.9% of patients, suggesting that delirium is a common neurological episode among this group. Under the careful analysis of Rogers et al., 2020, the etiology and epidemiology of psychiatric factors associated with Covid-19 are multifactorial, as they result from a possibly associated brain infection or from cerebrovascular diseases, along with sentimental aspects also reported by qualitative studies, such as loneliness, boredom, frustration through isolation and concern for family health. Finally, in this same manuscript, there is a significant relationship between post-traumatic stress and population and risk factors, such as female gender, health occupation and presence of avascular necrosis and distressing pain after SARS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research by Guo et al., 2020 resumes the topic of the highest rates of depression and anxiety among infected patients in relation to the control group. In this light, psychiatric disorders can become more intense, since apathy and anxiety are increasing in individuals with mild cognitive impairment, while agitation and aberrant motor behavior are aggravated in Alzheimer's disease patients (Beatriz Lara et al., 2020). Other comorbidities were also found in these individuals, often with older age (on average 77.4 years), being more frequent among women (60%): hypertension (60%), dyslipidemia (52.5%) and diabetes (30%). It is also seen that the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 with neurological aspects can affect different levels of the Central and Peripheral Nervous System, in addition to causing skeletal-muscular injury, representing 36.4% of the cases considered, including impairment of consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, seizure and neuropathic pain, for example (Bilbul et al., 2020). In an epidemiologically deeper approach, Dinakaran et al. (2020) reinforces a percentage value close to the one reported by Bilbul et al. (2020) regarding the neurological complaints of COVID-19 patients: 36%.\n",

    "4. Physiopathology\n",
    "4.1. Neuroinvasion and neurotropism\n",
    "Associated with multiple impairments on the individual's mental and physical health, both in their psychiatric and neurological consequences, the action of SARS-CoV-2 and the immune response of the human Central Nervous System have been the focus of pathophysiological investigation (Troyer et al., 2020). In this light, the neuroinvasive character of the virus in question and the manifestations at central and peripheral levels suffered by the referred system are raised: headache, dizziness - most common-, reduced level of consciousness, ataxia, impaired perception of taste and smell and neuropathic pain, possibly including also injury of skeletal muscle tissue (Bilbul et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). According to research by Beach et al. (2020) the emergence of this panorama, including acute encephalopathy, can reach more than a third of patients with COVID-19, in addition to delirium as a common phenomenon of the most serious infections. Moreover, a reading of the neuropsychiatric spectrum allows the association of post-infectious states with disorders, such as post-traumatic stress, depressed mood, anxiety and insomnia (Rogers et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the main clinical signs are related to respiratory function, SARS-CoV-2 is also capable of infecting cells of the Nervous System, intestinal mucosa, kidneys and lymphoid system, for example, culminating in nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, among other symptoms whose severity depends on tissue sensibility (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). For possible associations between SARS-CoV-2 tropism and neurological symptoms, it is necessary to understand its characteristics and its similarity to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 corresponds to a enveloped single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus, containing 29,891 nucleotides for the encoding of 9860 amino acids (Li et al., 2020). In view of this panorama, the studies by Li et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2020) roughly agree on the degree of similarity between pathogens: 79.5% and 89.1%, respectively, what allowed the discovery about the viral structure of these pathogens and their similarity in the infectious mechanism: interaction with Angiotensin-2 receptors (ACE-2) - abundant on the cell surface of various human organs (Li et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, also present in the cells of the Central Nervous System, it is possible that the ACE-2 receptor allows the action of SARS-CoV-2 in neuronal cells, that then activate the TMPRSS2 serine protease, allowing protein peak and, consequently, the virus entry. Such infectious mechanism can be potentiated by the infection of endothelial cells, which could cause damage to the blood-brain barrier and increase its permeability and vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, with slow blood flow in capillaries being a possible aggravating factor for the interaction between the virus and the endothelial cells of CNS vessels, whose consequences of this interaction are cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension, for example (Li et al., 2020; Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Furthermore, among the possibilities raised as neurological behaviors for the virus discussed, it is possible to elicit the action of SARS-COV-1 in animal experimentations, whose trajectory of the virus occurred through the respiratory tract, using peripheral nerves, such as the olfactory, to reach the SNC (Zhou et al., 2020; Troyer et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.2. Neuropsychiatric pathophysiology\n",
    "As discussed earlier, the spectrum of probable neurological and neuropsychiatric damage to COVID-19 patients is wide. From this perspective, the pathophysiology, although there is still a need for further studies, allows us to assume the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms and different manifestations (Troyer et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Acute Neuropsychiatric Symptoms, researches contemplated by Troyer et al. (2020), out of 217 hospitalized patients, almost half had cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies and myalgia - commonly combine with a reduced total number of lymphocytes and high reactive C protein. Furthermore, findings in children with COVID-19 also demonstrated a drop in lymphocytes. The high signalization of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is also linked to the invasion of the CNS by cells derived from monocytes, which allows us to raise the research of Serrano-Castro et al. (2020) regarding inflammatory persistence and invasion of hematopoietic cells, such as lymphocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages. In relation to encephalopathy, researches considered by Troyer et al. (2020) evaluated patients with COVID-19, in Wuhan (China), with considerable presence of encephalopathy and alterations in consciousness among these. Continuing these considerations, blood tests detected increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), characterizing Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS), in fatal COVID-19 patients. This condition, also noted by Serrano-Castro et al. (2020) reinforces these inflammatory disorders with reduced lymphocytes and increased cytokines, a condition also observed during SARS-VOC-1 infections. In addition, it is possible to raise delirium as a primary encephalopathy and harbinger of invasion of the CNS by SARS-COV-2 (Beach et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "The triggering of the cytokine storm has been described in studies by Grom et al. (2016) in a multiple model of pathogenic events in rheumatic diseases. In this approach, the genetic factors and the inflammatory environment created by the underlying rheumatic disease act synergistically to reach the threshold of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in the presence of an infectious trigger, according to Fig. 2, Fig. 3 .\n",

    "Regarding anosmia and ageusia, although greater formal publications on the subject are still needed, Troyer et al. (2020) considers, according to researches included in the manuscript, that the impairment of olfactory and gustatory perception occurs through the virus-receptor interaction and use by the pathogen of these sensory pathways to reach the CNS. In turn, the transition from the subacute phase to chronic sequelae caused by SARS-COV-2 should be analyzed. Depression and anxiety are common consequences of COVID-19 outbreaks. Although these psychiatric symptoms are often attributed to proximity to infected individuals and the atypical context of quarantine, the development of stress due to difficulty in breathing due to infection can trigger the release of corticotropic hormones, hypothalamic stimulation and the production of glucocorticoids with interference on brain metabolism (Li et al., 2020; Troyer et al., 2020). Other psychiatric complications can be raised from reported episodes of detection of HCoV antibodies in patients affected by recent psychotic episodes (Troyer et al., 2020). In this light, Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy/Guillain-Barré Syndrome has been observed in individuals infected with SARS-COV-2, with case reports in China, Italy and Spain, whose presumed underlying pathophysiology is the inflammatory trigger of cytokines generated by the infection, which can also be associated with Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy (Jasti et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pathophysiological mechanism is associated with the dysregulation of the cytokine network. Research evaluated by Troyer et al. (2020) and Serrano-Castro et al. (2020) demonstrate the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2R and CCL2, for example. In this way, organs damaged by severe states of infection can remain producing endogenous substances capable of generating chronic and systemic inflammation. In addition, the “cytokine storm” raises important questions about the degenerative chronicity in relation to the CNS specifically, given that other neurodegenerative pathologies originate from a similar mechanism, such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020). Troyer et al. (2020) highlight the exacerbated inflammatory reaction and its link with autoimmune mechanisms by COVID-19, since SARS-COV-1 and MERS-CoV present descriptions associated with autoimmune neurodegenerative syndromes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Injuries of skeletal muscle tissue occurs by breakage and weakening of muscular skeletal system - observable by high levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase - added to the muscle damage caused by inflammatory hyperreactivity (Jasti et al., 2020). Regarding to strokes when not associated with D-dimer (signaling particle of clot formation), a hypothesized relationship between the development of vasculitis secondary to cytokine reactions in the intracranial setting, similarly to what occurs in the triggered pathophysiology by SARS-CoV-2, is raised (Jasti et al., 2020). In regard to headaches, researches considered by Jasti et al. (2020) also highlight the relationship between inflammatory hyperreactivity as a responsible mechanism, in addition to the influence of hypoxia and changes in blood flow caused by the infection. As for seizures, they may also be secondary to the innate immune response of cytokines.\n",

    "5. Main repercussions\n",
    "Much has been discussed about the respiratory impacts of COVID-19. However, the disease is not limited to the respiratory system, but also affects the nervous system, with psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.1. Neuropsychiatric repercussions\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 has been increasingly associated with neurological manifestations (for example, febrile seizures, seizures, changes in mental status and encephalitis). The neurotropic and neuroinvasive capabilities of coronaviruses in humans have been described previously, such as entry into the CNS via the olfactory bulb, causing inflammation and demyelination (Asadi-Pooya and Simani, 2020). Neuropsychiatric repercussions refer to mental disorders caused by sequelae of brain damage or disease, which can arise from direct effects of CNS infection or indirect by an immune response or medical therapy (Rogers et al., 2020). Despite limited data and studies on neuropsychiatric presentations as a result of COVID-19, it is known that some symptoms are present in the course of the disease, either by direct spread of the virus or indirectly by physiological hyperinflammation (Jasti et al., 2020). It is estimated that more than a third of patients with COVID-19 develop neuropsychiatric symptoms (Beach et al., 2020). The neurpsychiatric repercussions are summarized in Fig. 4 .\n",

    "\n",
    "5.2. Nonspecific neurological symptoms\n",
    "Specific neurological symptoms such as seizures and cerebrovascular disorders are manifested in certain patients affected by COVID-19, in which SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion would partially explain respiratory failure in some cases. In contrast, nonspecific neurological symptoms can arise in patients affected by COVID-19, such as confusion and headache (Asadi-Pooya and Simani, 2020). The most described nonspecific symptoms are headache, myalgia, dizziness and fatigue (Carod Artal, 2020). In a study by Mao et al. (2020) with 214 hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, 36.4% had neurological manifestations. The most common symptoms of CNS manifestations were dizziness (36 cases) and headache (28 cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2.1. Delirium\n",
    "Delirium is a the most common neuropsychiatric presentation in patients with COVID-19, with symptomatic manifestation in 65% of patients in the intensive care unit, along with agitation and altered consciousness (Rogers et al., 2020). Beach et al. (2020) exposed a series of four cases in which patients experienced delirium as a result of infection with coronavirus. It is worth noting that three of the four cases did not have significant respiratory symptoms, but had a change in mental status as a presentation of the disease. With this rise in delirium rates as a symptom of COVID-19, it becomes necessary to assess whether changes in mental status should be incorporated into the test criteria. The pathophysiology of this mechanism remains unclear, and may be a primary manifestation, with the virus invading the nervous system, or secondary, through encephalopathy caused by inflammation or other systemic effects of the virus.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2.2. Cerebrovascular complications\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported to cause an event called cytokine storm, involving molecules that participate in the inflammatory process, produced by cells of the immune system. It is likely that this mechanism can cause cerebrovascular diseases. Furthermore, patients with severe COVID-19 have high levels of D-dimer and reduced platelets, which can lead to acute cerebrovascular events (Serrano-Castro et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2.3. Encephalopathy\n",
    "Encephalopathy is a transient syndrome of cerebral dysfunction, with impaired level of consciousness. It is known that patients with COVID-19 can suffer from cerebral hypoxia, which is a risk factor for encephalopathy. In addition, the cytokine storm resulting from the immune inflammatory process may cause this neuropsychiatric manifestation (Carod Artal, 2020; Troyer et al., 2020). Retrospective analyzes indicate the presence of encephalopathies in one fifth of individuals affected by COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Remarkably, plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher among fatal COVID-19. This converges with the report of the cytokine storm syndrome in SARS-CoV-1, which may be associated with encephalopathy. In addition to immunological manifestations, neurocognitive deficits and mild cognitive impairment have been reported in patients affected by COVID-19 (Troyer et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2.4. Neuromuscular disorders\n",
    "Muscle damage and myalgia were observed in patients with COVID-19, being manifested with elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels higher than patients without muscular symptoms. Another reason for this symptom may be the cytokine storm, which can contribute to the manifestation of ataxia (Jasti et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2.5. Anosmia and ageusia\n",
    "Smell and taste disorders are related to a wide variety of viral infections, including COVID-19. Out of the 59 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a hospital in Milan, Italy, 33.9% reported at least one taste or smell disorder, and 18.6% had both. Alterations in taste perception were more frequent before hospitalization, demonstrating that these symptoms are reasonably frequent and may precede the complete clinical appearance of the disease, requiring a careful look at these symptoms, which can represent a useful screening tool (Giacomelli et al., 2020). Formal studies have not yet been published for CoV-2-related anosmia despite an increasing number of clinical cases (Vaira et al., 2020); however, it has emerged as a screening criterion for COVID-19 in an increasing number of clinics. Experimental studies prior to those related to coronaviruses suggested that the alpha-coronavirus interrupts the ciliary nasal epithelium, a possible mechanism of olfactory dysfunction. Indeed, there is expression of the angiotensin receptors through which COVID-19 enters cells; in contrast, the specific cellular receptor subtype mediating anosmia remains uncertain (Troyer et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3. Psychiatric repercussions\n",
    "It is known that during a pandemic state, the environmental stress, coupled with fear, quarantine and symptom complaints can lead to different psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, psychiatric symptoms or post-traumatic stress (Li et al., 2020). Psychiatric symptoms associated with trauma were related to coronavirus outbreaks; however, there is need for confirmation if the risks are attributable to viral infections o immune responses. Therefore, it is essential to continuously monitor such clinical signs and their repercussions associated with SARS-CoV-2 (Troyer et al., 2020). The psychiatric repercussions are summarized in Fig. 5 .\n",

    "(Source: Authors)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3.1. Depression\n",
    "The response to infection for COVID-19 is a hyperinflammatory state in which there is an increase in the concentration of C-reactive protein, ferritin and interleukin-6, which, despite being a brief state, is likely to have a link with psychiatric problems (Rogers et al., 2020). The levels of C-reactive protein, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with patients who showed symptoms of depression. Thus, it is noticed that psychological suffering is something experienced by patients with COVID-19, and that inflammatory markers are related to the levels of depressive characteristics in these patients (Guo et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3.2. Anxiety\n",
    "Studies suggest that the social levels of symptoms associated with anxiety increase when a serious infectious disease spreads, such as the psychological burden caused by SARS-CoV1-, in which a considerable part of the sample presented anxiety disorders. A possible cause may be related to hypochondriac concerns and fear (Furer et al., 1997; Huang and Zhao, 2020). Among the various impacts of COVID-19, fear and uncertainty about the disease can precipitate disorders, such as anxiety. It is noticed that the pandemic affects more significantly patients who have already had psychiatric disorders, which may be related to pro-inflammatory cytokines in these patients (Hao et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3.3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n",
    "In the post-disease stage, with SARS and MERS infections as a parameter, patients may develop traumatic memories, with manifestations of post-traumatic stress disorder. It is necessary that health professionals are aware of the possibility of psychiatric repercussions, both during the course of the disease and in the long term (Rogers et al., 2020). In addition, these symptoms can go beyond infected patients, impacting the general population. A study in Wuhan, China, one month after the outbreak of COVID-19 showed that the prevalence of PTSD in the most affected areas in China was 7%. Health services must be designed to promote the psychological well-being of the population (Liu et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.3.4. Psychosis\n",
    "The presence of antibodies against coronavirus strains has been reported in individuals with psychosis, although most studies focus on the history of influenza infections and their relationship to the risk of psychosis. However, an increased prevalence of antibodies against four strains of HCoV in patients with a recent episode psychosis compared with non-psychiatric controls was found, suggesting a possible relationship between infections and psychosis, which may also occur with the SARS-CoV-2 (Troyer et al., 2020). Evidences suggest that 0.9 to 4% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop psychotic spectrum disorders (Dinakaran et al., 2020).\n",

    "6. Therapeutic interventions\n",
    "The challenges surrounding the treatment of COVID-19 become even more complex when referring to the involvement of the Nervous System. The dense parenchyma and the impermeability of brain tissues not only protect the brain from infectious processes, but also hinder its elimination in cases of brain involvement (Jasti et al., 2020). Therapeutic interventions are divided into areas of activity in Fig. 6 .\n",

    "6.1. Preventive methods for neuropsychiatric effects associated with the treatment of patients with COVID-19\n",
    "As the pandemic spreads in the population, the medical psychiatrists are being called upon to treat psychiatric conditions of the individuals with COVID-19 and are finding challenging clinical scenarios of multiple comorbidities and unknown drugs. In this sense, in view of the use of drugs with effects that are still little known, a rigorous assessment of the possible interactions between these drugs in vivo is necessary. Thus, the physician must be aware of the possibility of making adjustments to the medication arrangements, including avoiding the use of certain agents that can raise safety concerns (Bilbul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.1.1. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine\n",
    "These drugs have been reported to produce neuropsychiatric side effects such as agitation, personality change, depression and sleep disorders (Good and Shader, 1977; Juurlink, 2020). The responsible professional must recognize the presence of risk factors that induce such effects, which may be the simultaneous use of CYP3A4 inhibitors or low doses of glucocorticoids, in addition to the presence of family history of pre-existing psychiatric diseases, being female, low body weight and therapeutic overdose (Bilbul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.1.2. Remdesivir\n",
    "There is not enough information available on the neuropsychiatric repercussions of this drug, but its administration has been associated with hypotension, diaphoresis and tremor reactions, which can be mistaken as a panic attack (Bilbul et al., 2020). Thus, physicians must be aware of possible adverse effects, weighing the risks and benefits in making clinical decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 Psychotropic drugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several psychotropics have recently been named on a list of FDA-approved drugs with effective in vitro action against SARS-CoV-2 (Gordon et al., 2020). Among them, haloperidol, valproic acid and fluvoxamine are being tested for their ability to reduce hyperinflammation, for having antioxidant action and anti-inflammatory properties (Bilbul et al., 2020). In this way, psychiatrists can preferentially consider the use of these agents whenever appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2. Neuropsychiatric interventions\n",
    "6.2.1. Unspecific neurological complications\n",
    "The treatment of patients with neurological complications resulting from Sars-Cov- 2 requires greater caution, since certain drugs used as a therapeutic resource in normal conditions can aggravate the acute respiratory syndrome related to COVID-19. Out of these, immunosuppressive drugs for autoimmune neurological diseases and corticosteroid drugs stand out. In regard to typical second-line treatments for neuroinflammatory conditions, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) or plasma (PLEX) are less likely to delay viral clearance in COVID-19. However, this therapy should be well evaluated, since IVIg is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Finally, third-line medications, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab, represent a high risk regarding COVID-19 infection, and should be used as the last treatment choice (Needham et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2.2. Delirium\n",
    "The cases of delirium triggered by the COVID-19 infection have been related mainly to hyperactive or mixed varieties, with high degrees of anxiety, a fact that increases the challenge regarding treatment. In such cases, preference should be given to low-potency antipsychotic agents, including second-generation ones such as olanzapine and quetiapine, but also chlorpromazine (Beach et al., 2020). In addition, although there is limited evidence to support the use of any interventions in hyperactive delirium associated with COVID-19, most psychiatrists consider haloperidol as the best agent for controlling agitation in delusional patients (Bilbul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have also revealed that the administration of melatonin or melatonin receptor agonists (ARM) has been strongly associated with a reduction in the prevalence of delirium. In this sense, given its safety, melatonin should be considered a first-line agent to treat disorders of sleep-wake rhythm and consciousness, in addition to minimizing the administration of molecules that can cause central respiratory depression, such as benzodiazepines (Zambrelli et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that the prescription of benzodiazepines, opioids and drugs with strong cholinergic properties (tertiary amine, tricyclic antidepressants, low-potency antipsychotics, benztropine and diphenhydramine) can potentially cause or exacerbate confusion, sedation and/or falls in patients with COVID- 19 (Bilbul et al., 2020). Thus, health professionals must follow local guidelines and policies related to the monitoring and management of delirium, being necessary to implement easy screening methods for delirium especially in light of the heavy workload during the COVID-19 crisis (Kotfis et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2.3. Cerebrovascular complications\n",
    "The neurological clinical manifestations associated with the cytokine storm triggered by COVID-19 have been shown in three different ways: transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. The most recent indicators suggest that the cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 may be due to coagulopathy. In these patients, which damage is likely to be caused by the host's response to viral infection, establishing causality is even more challenging. Therefore, immediate anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin was recommended in order to reduce the risk of thrombotic disease. For patients with cerebrovascular accident (CVA), cerebral angiography, intracranial imaging of the vessel wall and, if necessary, brain biopsy, in searches for vasculitis should also be considered (Ellul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2.4. Encephalopathies\n",
    "So far, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis has been observed. However, some recommendations include the use of anticonvulsants, antiviral drugs and antibiotics. The diagnosis of viral encephalitis should be based on clinical evidence of brain inflammation, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, imaging alterations, focal seizures or histological alterations. It is worth mentioning that, even if the virus is detected in the CSF, encephalitis should not be diagnosed, unless there is evidence of brain inflammation (Ellul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2.5. Neuromuscular disorders\n",
    "When investigating patients with limb weakness and sensory changes, it is essential to distinguish between peripheral nerve disease, such as GBS, and inflammation of the spinal cord, which can present flaccid paralysis if the cells of the anterior horn are involved. For this purpose, CSF examination, neurophysiological studies and imaging of the spine are essential (Ellul et al., 2020). The use of neuromuscular non-depolarizing blocking agent is reported as a risk factor for the development of myopathy due to critical illness. However, this was not observed in patients with other coronaviruses who received short cycles of these drugs (Guidon and Amato, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2.6. Anosmia and ageusia\n",
    "The prior recognition of sensory symptoms possibly related to COVID-19 becomes extremely important because it would avoid the risk of inadequate treatment (such as anti-inflammatory predominant therapy, especially nasal and systemic corticosteroids and immunomodulators), which are contraindicated in case of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, psychiatrists, neurologists and doctors in general should be aware of this presentation of symptoms to avoid mistreatment, given that persistent olfactory dysfunction can increase the risk of nutritional deficit and lead to the development of other disorders (Pallanti, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.3. Psychiatric interventions\n",
    "6.3.1. Depression\n",
    "Many of the experimental treatments for COVID-19, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have high potential for neuropsychiatric effects related to the development of depression. It has also been shown that tocilizumab may have some positive effects on depressive symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to these, azithromycin, vitamin C and corticosteroids have also been shown to induce depression depending on the dose and the therapeutic cycle (Bilbul et al., 2020). Therefore, the clinical management of these drugs should always be cautious. Finally, for the treatment of depression triggered by a state of hyperinflammation resulting from the infection, immune modulation therapies, such as interleukin-6 inhibitors and melatonin, are under investigation, and other therapies such as cytokine blocking drugs and Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK) have also been suggested (Ferrando et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.3.2. Anxiety\n",
    "The psychiatrist may be asked to evaluate and manage COVID-19 patients with anxiety or panic symptoms, in addition to breathing difficulties. Although there may be situations in which the use of small doses of benzodiazepines is appropriate, it is important to highlight its potential for respiratory depression. Therefore, physicians need to consider the risks and benefits of using benzodiazepines in patients with prominent respiratory symptoms. Depending on the circumstances and symptoms of each patient, alternative medications such as gabapentin, buspirone, hydroxyzine or a low dose of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used. In addition, non-pharmacological and psychological interventions, such as psychotherapy, should also be prioritized (Bilbul et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.3.3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)\n",
    "Studies conducted in Wuhan province with people with acute PTSD during the COVID-19 outbreak reported the need for a broader, more comprehensive psychological intervention. According to the data obtained, women, people with a recent history of exposure to the virus and people at high risk of infection or poor sleep quality deserve special attention, as these indicators were defined as strong precursors for the development of disorders typical of post-traumatic stress. In this perspective, the health professional is responsible for the early detection and intervention for PTSD, with a in-depth assessment of the risk factors that can lead to psychological problems, including previous mental health problems, grief, personal or family injuries, circumstances with life risk, panic, separation from the family and low family income (Sun et al., 2020; Duan and Zhu, 2020.). To this end, the development of teams with specialists qualified to deal with emotional stress, in addition to the training of community health workers regards basic aspects of mental health care, is essential (Rajkumar, 2020).\n",

    "6.3.4. Psychosis\n",
    "The relationship between the development of psychosis in patients with COVID-19 and the previous existence of psychiatric vulnerability was observed. In order to diagnose this condition, delirium should be considered in these patients and, in case of psychosis caused by COVID-19, the treatment of psychotic symptoms should be done with antipsychotic medication, although the possible complications triggered by these drugs due to the underlying infection by COVID-19 must be highlighted. (Ferrando et al., 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.4. Concluding remarks\n",
    "The clinical worsening of the COVID-19 infection is mainly due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; however, analyzing the atypical repercussions, including psychiatric and neuropsychiatric ones, is fundamental to mitigate the direct and indirect damages of this pandemic event. The main psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, nonspecific neurological symptoms, delirium, cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, anosmia and ageusia. The psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms of acute respiratory syndromes can appear during or after the infectious stage. Among the risk factors pointed out for such effects are the female gender, health professionals, presence of avascular necrosis and distressing pain. Therefore, it is necessary to intervene therapeutically through pharmacological and non-pharmacological means regarding such disorders; however, it is still important to observe the psychiatric effects of the drugs that are being used to treat COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "SARS-CoV-2 infection has a broad pathophysiological spectrum due to the availability of tissues with ACE-2 receptors. Through a first contact of the human organism with the aforementioned virus, the innate immunity acts in an increased way, generating exacerbated pro-inflammatory reactions, whose landmark is the “cytokine storm”, a key point for alterations in the neuronal tissue and the endothelial tissue attached to it. From this mechanism, studies point it as a trigger for encephalopathies, CNS autoimmune diseases, psychiatric and peripheral changes in the system in question, among other disorders which the studies about are still inconclusive. Our analytical limitations are essentially due to the scarce original articles and reviews on psychiatric and neuropsychiatric symptoms, which have their therapeutic interventions based on relatively small groups or case reports. More specifically, although certain mechanisms of pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders are more consistent, others are assumed based on the interactions between the central nervous system and MERS or SARS-CoV-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.5. Core messages\n",
    "The preliminary clinical descriptions about COVID-19 turned to respiratory symptoms, however atypical presentations were increasingly recognized, among them, the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions.\n",

    "Under the pathophysiological perspective, complex mechanisms are being proposed about neurotropism and neuroinvasion, as well as inflammatory mechanisms, such as the cytokine storm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main psychiatric and neuropsychiatric repercussions analyzed in this chapter were depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, psychosis, nonspecific neurological symptoms, delirium, cerebrovascular complications, encephalopathies, neuromuscular disorders, anosmia and ageusia.\n",

    "We believe that it is essential to analyze not only psychiatric and neuropsychiatric disorders, but also therapeutic interventions in a pharmacological and non-pharmacological way, in addition to observing the psychiatric effects of the drugs that are being used to treat COVID-19.\"\"\"\n",

    "Materials and Methods\n",
    "This retrospective review included patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction–confirmed COVID-19 who presented between January 12, 2020, and February 6, 2020. Patients with severe respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement at any time during the disease course were excluded. Repeat chest CT was performed at approximately 4-day intervals. Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement and 5 indicating more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement).\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Twenty-one patients (six men and 15 women aged 25–63 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were evaluated. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained in these patients, with a mean interval (±standard deviation) of 4 days ± 1 (range, 1–8 days). All patients were discharged after a mean hospitalization period of 17 days ± 4 (range, 11–26 days). Maximum lung involved peaked at approximately 10 days (with a calculated total CT score of 6) from the onset of initial symptoms (R2 = 0.25, P < .001). Based on quartiles of chest CT scans from day 0 to day 26 involvement, four stages of lung CT findings were defined. CT scans obtained in stage 1 (0–4 days) showed ground-glass opacities (18 of 24 scans [75%]), with a mean total CT score of 2 ± 2; scans obtained in stage 2 (5–8 days) showed an increase in both the crazy-paving pattern (nine of 17 scans [53%]) and total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4; P = .002); scans obtained in stage 3 (9–13 days) showed consolidation (19 of 21 scans [91%]) and a peak in the total CT score (mean, 7 ± 4); and scans obtained in stage 4 (≥14 days) showed gradual resolution of consolidation (15 of 20 scans [75%]) and a decrease in the total CT score (mean, 6 ± 4) without crazy-paving pattern.\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "In patients recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), four stages of evolution on chest CT scans were identified from symptom onset: early stage (0–4 days), progressive stage (5–8 days), peak stage (9–13 days), and absorption stage (≥14 days).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Results\n",
    "■ In patients who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), initial lung findings on chest CT scans were small subpleural ground-glass opacities (GGOs) that grew larger with crazy-paving pattern and consolidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "■ Lung involvement increased to consolidation up to 2 weeks after symptom onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "■ After 2 weeks, the lesions were gradually absorbed leaving extensive GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Since December 2019, many gathered cases of “unknown viral pneumonia” have been reported. These cases were initially linked to exposure at the Huanan Seafood Market, Wuhan, China (1). A novel coronavirus capable of infecting humans was formally confirmed on January 6, 2020 (2,3), and termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (2). By February 7, 2020, there were 43 103 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (previously called 2019-nCoV) in 25 countries (4). Similar to other coronaviral pneumonia such as severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, COVID-19 can also lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (1,5). With the gradual recognition of COVID-19, professional consensus, guidelines, and criteria were steadily established with the aim of preventing transmission and facilitating diagnosis and treatment (6–8).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the recently published literature, typical radiologic images of COVID-19 demonstrated clear destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma, including interstitial inflammation and extensive consolidation, similar to the previously reported coronavirus infection (1,9–11). However, some patients with COVID-19 consistently demonstrated no hypoxemia or respiratory distress during the course of hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to determine the change in chest CT findings associated with COVID-19 from initial diagnosis until patient recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials and Methods\n",
    "This study was approved by the ethics committees of Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The requirement to obtain informed consent for this retrospective study was waived. The anonymous data were collected and analyzed to facilitate better clinical decisions and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic and Discharge Criteria\n",
    "According to the preliminary diagnosis and treatment protocols from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, COVID-19 was based on the following criteria: (a) epidemiologic history (travel and/or residence history in Wuhan or exposure history to patients with fever and respiratory symptoms from Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of illness); (b) clinical manifestations (fever, imaging characteristics of pneumonia, and/or normal or decreased white blood cell count or decreased lymphocyte count); and (c) laboratory diagnosis (real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed positive detection of COVID-19 in throat swabs or lower respiratory tract) (7,8). Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were hospitalized and isolated for treatment. The discharge criteria were as follows: (a) patient was afebrile for more than 3 days, (b) respiratory symptoms significantly improved, (c) there was improvement in the radiologic abnormalities on chest radiographs or chest CT scans, and (d) there were two consecutive negative COVID-19 nucleic acid tests at least 24 hours apart (7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients\n",
    "In this single-center study, records from patients with COVID-19 were reviewed retrospectively for the period from January 12, 2020, to February 6, 2020. Patients with severe pneumonia during the disease course were excluded. Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), requirement for oxygen treatment or mechanical ventilation, and oxygen saturation as measured with pulse oximetry of less than 90% on room air (6).\n",
    "\n",
    "CT Protocol\n",
    "Chest CT was performed with two commercial multidetector CT scanners (Philips Ingenuity Core128, Philips Medical Systems, Best, the Netherlands; Somatom Definition AS, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) by using a single inspiratory phase. To minimize motion artifacts, patients were instructed on breath-holding. CT images were then acquired during a single breath-hold. For CT acquisition, the tube voltage was 120 kVp with automatic tube current modulation. From the raw data, CT images were reconstructed with a matrix size of 512 × 512 as axial images (thickness, 1.5 mm; increment, 1.5 mm) in transverse slice orientation with either hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose level 5, Philips Medical Systems) or a pulmonary B70F kernel and a mediastinal B30f kernel (Siemens Healthineers). The mean CT dose index volume (±standard deviation) was 8.4 mGy ± 2.0 (range, 5.2–12.6 mGy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Chest CT Evaluation\n",
    "The major CT findings were described by using internationally standard nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary and peer-reviewed literature on viral pneumonia, using terms including ground-glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation (12–14). A semiquantitative scoring system was used to quantitatively estimate the pulmonary involvement of all these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved (15). Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no involvement; 1, less than 5% involvement; 2, 5%–25% involvement; 3, 26%–49% involvement; 4, 50%–75% involvement; and 5, more than 75% involvement. The total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distribution of lung abnormalities was recorded as predominantly subpleural (involving mainly the peripheral one-third of the lung), random (without predilection for subpleural or central regions), or diffuse (continuous involvement without respect to lung segments) (16).\n",
    "\n",
    "Image analysis was performed by three radiologists (C.Z., B.L., and L.Y., with 26, 25, and 22 years of experience in thoracic radiology, respectively) with use of the institutional digital database system (Vue PACS, version 11.3.5.8902; Carestream Health, Oakville, Canada). Final scores were determined by consensus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Analysis\n",
    "Statistical analyses were performed by using software (SPSS, version 24; IBM, New York, NY). Quantitative data are presented as means ± standard deviations and ranges, and qualitative data are presented as the percentage of the total unless otherwise specified. The total CT score of pulmonary involvement as a function of time was quantitively assessed by using the SPSS curve estimation module. The comparisons of nonpaired and paired quantitative data were evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon test, according to the normal distribution assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. P < .05 was indicative of a statistically significant difference.\n",

    "A total of 21 patients (six men and 15 women) were included in the study. The mean patient age was 40 years ± 9 (Table 1). The most prevalent symptoms at presentation were fever (18 of 21 patients [86%]) and cough (12 of 21 patients [57%]). Four patients had no chest CT abnormalities at baseline evaluation.\n",

The first chest CT scan was obtained a mean of 2 days ± 2 (range, 0–9 days) after the onset of symptoms. A total of 82 chest CT scans were obtained, and each patient had a mean of four CT scans ± 1 (range, 3–6), with a mean interval of 4 days ± 1 (range, 1–8 days) between scans (Fig 1).

    "Discussion\n",
    "The purpose of this study was to determine the change in chest CT findings associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from initial diagnosis until patient recovery. We studied patients with COVID-19 at approximately 4-day intervals from the onset of symptoms until recovery. Patients with complicated pneumonia, defined as severe respiratory distress (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute), requirement for oxygen treatment or mechanical ventilation, or oxygen saturation as measured with pulse oximetry of less than 90% on room air, were excluded. In patients without severe respiratory disease, the major pulmonary CT findings of COVID-19 were ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation predominantly in subpleural locations in the lower lobes. The number and severity of lesions seen at chest CT increased in the first 10 days (peaking at approximately 10 days). Subsequently, there was a short plateau phase and a gradual decrease in abnormalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients in our study had multiple chest CT scans at different time points (at least three), which provided reliable data on the dynamic radiologic pattern. The typical mild COVID-19 mainly starts as small subpleural unilateral or bilateral GGOs in the lower lobes, which then develops into the crazy-paving pattern and subsequent consolidation. After more than 2 weeks, the lesions are gradually absorbed with residual GGO and subpleural parenchymal bands. In these patients who recovered from COVID-19, four stages of lung involvement were defined on CT scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 1 (early stage, 0–4 days after the onset of initial symptoms), GGO was the main radiologic demonstration (Fig 2, A) and was distributed subpleurally in the lower lobes unilaterally or bilaterally. In our cohort, four patients had normal CT findings (total CT score = 0) (Fig 3, A). However, repeat chest CT showed lung abnormalities in these four patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 2 (progressive stage, 5–8 days after the onset of initial symptoms), the infection rapidly aggravated and extended to a bilateral multilobe distribution with diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 3 (peak stage, 9–13 days after the onset of the initial symptoms), the involved area of the lungs slowly increased to peak involvement and dense consolidation became more prevalent. Findings included diffuse GGO, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and residual parenchymal bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 4 (absorption stage, ≥14 days after the onset of initial symptoms), the infection was controlled and the consolidation was gradually absorbed. However, in this process, extensive GGO could be observed as the demonstration of the consolidation absorption (Fig 5, D). Noticeably, the crazy-paving pattern was no longer observed in this stage, likely as a result of recovery. On the basis of the total CT score, the absorption stage extended beyond 26 days (our last days of follow-up) from the onset of initial symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of this study include the retrospective nature of our analysis and lack of a comparison group with severe COVID-19. Most of the patients with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome are still hospitalized (17). Therefore, the analysis was limited to patients with mild COVID-19.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, most patients who recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 showed the greatest severity of lung disease on CT scans obtained at approximately 10 days after the initial onset of symptoms. Signs of improvement at chest CT began at approximately 14 days after the onset of initial symptoms.\n",

      "discussion\n",
      "pneumatoceles are lung cysts which are defined as intraparenchymal airfilled spaces with distinct thin walls that occur after pneumonia or trauma these cavities are formed when prior lung necrosis resolves into an airfilled cavity that subsequently is maintained by inflammatory cells within the feeding airway that act as a oneway valve pneumatoceles are differentiated from other types of lung cysts such as incidental cysts by their transient nature and association with known inciting events\n",
      "\n",
      "cystic structures that meet the definition of pneumatoceles have been described during covid pneumonia although their natural history is unknown in noncovid disease states pneumatoceles typically resolve without intervention however pneumatoceles may become infected expand and cause tension physiologic conditions or rupture resulting in pneumothorax these complex pneumatoceles can be treated successfully with catheter placement or surgical intervention however there are no widely accepted guidelines on to how to manage pneumothorax in this setting\n",
      "\n",
      "a pneumothorax is defined by air in the pleural space a pneumothorax that occurs without an inciting event is known as a spontaneous pneumothorax a spontaneous pneumothorax that occurs in patients with no known lung disease is called a primary spontaneous pneumothorax psp a pneumothorax that occurs in the setting of an underlying lung disease is known as a secondary spontaneous pneumothorax ssp however up to  of patients with presumed psp have undiagnosed blebs and bullae that can be detected by chest ct imaging which makes the distinction between psp and ssp less clear causes of ssp are heterogenous given the variety of predisposing illnesses that include emphysema cystic lung disease cystic fibrosis lung malignancy and necrotizing pneumonia in the initial aids epidemic pneumocystosis due to pneumocystis jirovecii was a wellknown cause of spontaneous pneumothorax including spontaneous bilateral pneumothoraces\n",
      "\n",
      "pneumothoraces can become loculated when air is trapped in a cavity between lung and chest wall due to adhesions in the case of a loculated hydropneumothorax that occurs in a lung fissure it can be difficult to differentiate from a pulmonary abscess or large pneumatocele a combination of epidemiology symptoms laboratory data and chest imaging may aid in this process most pulmonary abscesses are caused by aspiration and involve polymicrobial infections that include anaerobic bacteria unlike pneumatoceles which are typically asymptomatic and resolve without intervention pulmonary abscesses present with fever cough andor chest pain a hydropneumothorax is caused by a variety of processes that include necrotizing pneumonia and thoracic procedures with variable symptoms that reflect both the size of the hydropneumothorax and state of the underlying condition a loculated hydropneumothorax in a fissure is likely to be elliptical on coronal imaging to have a smooth inner surface and to displace airways in contrast a pneumatocele is commonly spherical on coronal imaging and a pulmonary abscess typically has thick walls with airways that lead into or through the cavity potentially creating air bronchograms\n",
      "\n",
      "current guidelines by the british thoracic society indicate that psp can be managed in the outpatient setting with observation if the pneumothorax is small and asymptomatic but recommend admission for supplemental oxygen and needle decompression if the pneumothorax is large or if the patient is symptomatic chest tube placement is reserved for patients in whom needle decompression fails surgical intervention with pleurodesis should be considered in patients with recurrent pneumothorax or persistent air leak after chest tube placement guidelines do not recommend obtaining a chest ct image in cases of psp however there is considerable debate around this topic because chest ct imaging might identify patients with psp who would benefit from surgical management to prevent recurrent pneumothorax\n",
      "\n",
      "for ssp the british thoracic society recommends a more aggressive treatment approach all patients with ssp should be admitted regardless of intervention strategy additionally most patients with symptomatic pneumothorax should be treated with chest tube placement and consideration of surgical intervention such as videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery with pleurodesis these guidelines are based largely on epidemiologic data that suggests that ssp is less likely to resolve and more likely to recur than psp management of a hydropneumothorax is guided currently by expert opinion and case reports although the british thoracic society guidelines suggest that most patients will require chest tube drainage the final management approach should be based on both the clinical status of the patient and the diagnostic testing that is required to identify and treat the cause of the patient’s hydropneumothorax\n",
      "\n",
      "clinical course\n",
      "after chest tube placement for his recurrent pneumothorax the patient’s symptoms of chest pain shortness of breath and scant hemoptysis improved his sputum stains and cultures were negative for bacteria mycobacteria and fungi blood cultures were negative based on the lack of infectious symptoms and chest ct findings of a thinwalled elliptical fluidfilled air cavity at the site of the major fissure the large airfluid filled structure was deemed a loculated hydropneumothorax rather than a large pneumatocele or lung abscess on day  there was no longer an air leak from the chest tube and it was successfully removed surgical referral for pleurodesis was deferred as the pneumatoceles had diminished in size at month follow up the patient’s symptoms had largely resolved repeat chest ct images demonstrated resolution of prior pneumatoceles and a significant decrease in the size of the loculated hydropneumothorax fig \n",
